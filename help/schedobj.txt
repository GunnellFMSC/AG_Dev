\fbScheduling Actions by Year or Condition\f0

Management activities and many other actions in \bFVs:FVS\b (including several 
\bkeywordS:keywords\b) can be scheduled by Year or Condition.  You pick which 
scheduling option you desire using a common set of elements found in many 
windows.  The elements include the following:

The \f1Schedule by Year/Cycle\f0 radio button is used when the activity is 
being scheduled to occur in a given year of simulated time, or in a given 
\bcyclE:FVS cycle\b.  

The \f1Schedule by Condition\f0 radio button is used when the activity is 
being scheduled to occur when a condition, or logical expression, is found to 
be true by FVS. 

Below each radio button, additional elements are used to further specify the 
year or condition. 

When you Schedule by Year, enter the year or cycle in a text edit field.  The
default year is the inventory year, or the year last defined using the 
scheduling year dialog (described below).  If an integer value between 1 
and 40 is coded, FVS interprets the value as a cycle number.  If zero is 
coded, FVS will automatically schedule the activity for every cycle in a 
simulation.  

Use the \f1Select Year\f0 button to start a dialog designed for
\lSCHYEARDialog:selecting a scheduling year\l.

Whey you Schedule by Condition, you must select the condition using another 
window.  During the simulation, FVS will schedule the activity in the year 
that the condition is found true plus the number of years entered in the text 
edit field below the Schedule by Condition radio button.  

Press the \f1Condition\f0 button to open a window used to 
\lSCHCONDWindow:specify a condition\l.  

HTOPIC SCHYEARDialog "Selecting a Scheduling Year" scheduling_activities
\fbSelecting a Scheduling Year\f0

This window is used to pick a scheduling year for an activity.  When the 
dialog is opened, the default year is set to the year last used in this 
window, or the \bstartYeaR:common starting year\b of the simulation. 

Use the slide bar to change the year, or type in a year in the text edit box.

Press \f1Ok\f0 to close the window and report the selected year to the 
activity window.

Press \f1Cancel\f0 to close the window and discard the scheduling year.

Note that many FVS activities are actually simulated at the beginning 
of an \bcyclE:FVS cycle\b.  Suppose does not insure that the date you specify 
occurs at a year equal to the beginning of an FVS cycle.  And, Suppose does 
not automatically add cycles to insure that a cycle boundary occurs at the 
date you specify as a scheduling date. 

HTOPIC SCHCONDWindow "Specifying a Condition" logical condition scheduling_activities
\fbSpecifying a Condition\f0

Use this window to select the condition on which scheduling the activity is 
predicated.  This window is also used to edit an existing condition.

Use the text box at the top of this window to change the name of the condition 
if you want a different name than the default (the condition is a separate 
\bcomponenT:component\b from the activity, so it has it's own name).

Pick a condition from the \f1Condition library\f0.  A default condition is 
often preselected for your use.  Each activity may have a unique default 
condition.  If no condition is picked, you must pick one.

When a condition from the Condition library is selected, you will find
elements used to set the parameters of the condition in the main body
of this window.  Each condition will have different elements and
instructions.

As an alternative to using a condition from the 
\f1Condition library\f0, you can pick one of \f1Your conditions\f0.
To access your conditions, open the list button and pick 
\f1Your conditions\f0 rather than \f1Condition library\f0.  When you
select this alternative, Suppose attempts to open a file stored in
your working directory called \fccondlib.kcp\f0 (if Suppose can not
open this file, it will allow you to specify a different file name or
cancel the operation).  The list box is loaded with condition
components found in this file.  You may select one from the list. 

Note that you can not edit the condition component nor set it's
parameters when you pick it.  You may edit it after it is in the
simulation using the \lEDITSimulationFile:Edit Simulation File\l
tool.  

Press \f1Ok\f0 to accept the selections and close the window.

Press \f1Attach to...\f0 to notify Suppose that you want the 
activity predicated on a condition that is already part of the simulation.  
Conditions that are part of the 
\lCURRENTRadioGroup:current group or stand\l are displayed in a list
box.  An example use of this feature would be scheduling the setting
of cutting preferences predicated on the same rule used to schedule a
thinning that uses those cutting preferences.

Press \f1Free form\f0 to transfer the currently selected condition
from the \f1Condition library\f0, or a blank condition in the case
where no condition is selected, to the Expression Editor.  Using this
button is the same as using the "Edit Logical Expression" menu item.
You can then change or expand the logic of a condition in any way you
desire using the full power of the FVS Event Monitor.

Press \f1Cancel\f0 to close the window without creating a condition or 
without changing a condition that your are editing.
