The Edit Tree Data File window supports the process of editing 
\lFVSTREEDATA:FVS Tree Data\l.  

An overview of the \lvegdatA:vegetation data used by Suppose\l 
is available.

The contents of the tree data file are related to a stand by placing
the name of the tree data file in \lstandlistFile:stand list file\l 
records.  A stand list file can be edited using the 
\lEDITSLFWindow:Edit Stand List File\l window.

Note that this window does not support an undo feature.  Press
\f1Cancel\f0 to close the window without saving any changes to the
currently loaded file.

Press the \f1Browse\f0 button to select an FVS Tree Data File or type the
desired file name in the text box and press the return key.  If the
file exists, it must be in the standard FVS format.

Set the FVS \bvarianT:variant\b which will be used with this tree
data.  This selection loads the list buttons with codes applicable to
the variant.  Changing this selection does not change the selected
variant for running a simulation.  That is done using the 
\lSELVARWindow:Select Variant and Extension\l window.

To access a given record, enter the record number in the text box and
press the enter key.

Press \f1\<\<Prev\f0 or \f1Next\>\>\f0 to navigate through the
records.

Press \f1New\f0 to insert a blank record (or a copy of the
\f1Template\f0 as described near the end of this help text) after
the current record.

Press \f1Delete\f0 to delete the current record.

Press \f1Duplicate\f0 to duplicate the current record, placing the
duplicate after the current record.

The contents of the current record are displayed just below a column
ruler. 

A scrolling box is provided to display and change the stand-level
data associated with each record.  Note these important facts
regarding the fields within the scrolling box.

\i20.1.	Use the text boxes to change values.  Use the \f1Enter Key\f0
on your keyboard to navigate between text boxes or use your mouse.

\i20.2.	A list button is supplied when a coded value has a
corresponding definition.  The values in the list box may depend on
the FVS \bvarianT:variant\b selected at the top of the window.

\i20.3.	The value in the text box is the value used regardless of any
data displayed in a corresponding list button.  

\i20.4.	See \lFVSTREEDATA:FVS Tree Data\l description for more information.
Pressing the \f1Help\f0 buttons adjacent to some of the text boxes
displays this description.  Codes needed for some of the fields are
described in that help file.

Press \f1Ok\f0 to save the current file and close the window.

Press \f1Save\f0 to save the current file without closing the window.

Press \f1Save As\f0 to save the current data with a different file
name without closing the window.

Press \f1Template\f0 to set the current record as a template, or to
unset the template if one is already set.  You can set, unset, and set
again the template by pressing the button repeatedly.  If you set a
template, and press the \f1New\f0 button, the template is used to
supply the new record rather than a blank record.

The \f1Import\f0 feature is not yet supported. 

Press \f1Cancel\f0 to close the window without saving the data.  Note
that this is the only way to avoid saving the changes you have made.
