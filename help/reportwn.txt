HTOPIC GENERATEReports "Generate Reports"
\fbGenerate Reports\f0

The Generate Reports window allows you to build custom reports using
data in the output files generated by \bFVs:FVS\b.  The custom reports
are designed to be directly transferred to other programs like word
processors and spread sheets.

There are 4 companion windows to this window, as follows:

\i20.-	\lGENERATEGraphs:Generate Graphs\l allows you to create line
graphs and bar charts of the data generated by FVS.

\i20.-	\lREADFVSOutput:Read FVS Output\l is used to select FVS output
files to read. 

\i20.-	\lAVERAGEFVSOutput:Average FVS Output\lis used to create
weighted averages of \bcasE:cases\b.

\i20.-	\lVARIABLEPicker:Pick Variable\l is used to select the data
you would like to display.

The elements of the Generate Reports window are described below:

Use the \f1Title text box\f0 to enter a report title.  This title is
output (output options are described below) with the report.

Select the \f1Report Type\f0 using the list button found in the upper
right corner of the window.  There are several report types, but only
two are currently implemented: 

\i20.-	\f1List over years\f0 -- the year corresponding to the
observation is listed in the first column.  Note that sometimes two
lines for the same year will be listed.  In that case, the first
corresponds to the datum prior to tree removals and the second to
after removals.  See 
\lvariableTricks:Tricks with Event Monitor Variables\l to see how you
can cause this to happen when using the Event Monitor.

\i20.-	\f1List over tree records\f0 -- the tree identification 
corresponding to the observation is listed in the first column (not 
yet implemented).

\i20.-	\f1List over cases\f0 -- the \bcasE:case\b corresponding to the
observation is listed in the first column.

\i20.- \f1List over obs identifier\f0 -- Observations in a set are
each tagged with an identifier.  With this option, the observation
identification is listed in the first column.  Observation
identifications can be defined for compute variables (see the class
level or the Event Monitor suffix 
(see \lvariableTricks:Tricks with Event Monitor Variables\l). 

Press \f1Pick Variable\f0 to display the
\lVARIABLEPicker:Pick Variable\l window that corresponds to the first
column.  Once a variable is picked, the title of the button
changes to the variable name with an appropriate prefix.  You can push
the button again to specify a different variable, to delete it from
the report, or to take one of several other actions.

The prefix to the variable name depends on the report type.
For \f1List over years\f0 the prefix is the case identification.  For
example, \fcc2:\f0 signifies the second case.  When the graph type is
\f1List over cases\f0 the variable name is prefaced with the year
corresponding to the displayed values.

Press \f1Next Case\f0 to display the same variable for the next
\bcasE:case\b in the list of cases.  

Press \f1Next Variable\f0 to display the next variable in the list of
variables, for the same case.

Press \f1New Column\f0 to open a new column without selecting a
variable or a case.

Press \f1Write Report\f0 to output the contents of the window to a
file as a tab delimited file (that is, tabs are written between each
field of data).  Character data is quoted.  This style of file is easy
to import into word processors, spread sheets, and data bases.

You can also \f1Copy\f0 the text to your computer system clipboard
using the Edit menu item or standard key strokes as appropriate for
your computer system.  The text can then be pasted into other
applications for additional analysis.  Building a graph using a spread
sheet and Suppose to organize your data can be accomplished in just a
few minutes using the cut/paste approach.

Press \f1Clear Report\f0 to delete all the data in the report.

Press \f1Read FVS Output\f0 to start the \lREADFVSOutput:Read FVS Output\l
window.  You can do this at any time to add new cases to the list.

Press \f1Reports\f0 to start another Generate Reports window.  You can
have many report windows opened at the same time. 

Press \f1Close\f0 to close the window.  This does not imply clearing
the cases.  

HTOPIC GENERATEGraphs "Generate Graphs"
\fbGenerate Graphs\f0

The Generate Graphs window allows you to to create line graphs and
bar charts of the data generated by FVS.

There are 4 companion windows to this window, as follows:

\i20.-	\lGENERATEReports:Generate Reports\l window allows you to
build custom reports using data in the output files generated by
\bFVs:FVS\b.

\i20.-	\lREADFVSOutput:Read FVS Output\l is used to select FVS output
files to read. 

\i20.-	\lAVERAGEFVSOutput:Average FVS Output\lis used to create
weighted averages of \bcasE:cases\b.

\i20.-	\lVARIABLEPicker:Pick Variable\l is used to select the data
you would like to display.

The elements of the Generate Graphs are described below:

Use the \f1Title text box\f0 to enter a graph title. 

Select the \f1Graph Type\f0 using the list button found in the upper
right corner of the window.  There are several graph types, but only
three are currently implemented: 

\i20.-	\f1Line: Y over years\f0 -- Plot selected variables over
years.  Note that sometimes two points for the same year will be
plotted.  That that case, the first corresponds to the datum prior to
tree removals and the second to after removals.  See
\lvariableTricks:Tricks with Event Monitor Variables\l to see how you
can cause this to happen when using the Event Monitor.

\i20.-	\f1Scatter: Y over X\f0 -- Select an X variable and one or more
Y variables to build a scatter plot.

\i20.-	\f1Bar: Y by obs identifier\f0 -- Build a bar for each
observation in a set.  Observations in a set are each tagged with an
identifier.  If the observation tag is a species, then the chart shows
species composition.  If the tag is size class, then the charts shows
composition by size class.  Observation tags can be defined for
compute variables (see
\lvariableTricks:Tricks with Event Monitor Variables\l for more 
information).

\i20.-	\f1Bar: Y by cases\f0 -- Build a bar chart to compare
variables at a single point in time over all \bcasE:cases\b (for these
charts, the case identification is the observation tag).

\i20.-	\f1Phase: class level by year\f0 -- Build a line chart that
shows the classification of a stand over time.  The Y-axis displays
the class levels for a variable and vectors are drawn to show the
class level over time and the transitions from class to class.  See 
\lvariableTricks:Tricks with Event Monitor Variables\l to see how to
define class-type variables in the Event Monitor.

See \lgraphScaling:How Scaling is Done\l to better understand how to
interpret the graphs.

Press \f1Pick Variable\f0 to display the 
\lVARIABLEPicker:Pick Variable\l window that corresponds to the
variable to plot.  Once a variable is picked, the title of the button
changes to the variable name with an appropriate prefix.  You can push
the button again to specify a different variable, to delete it from
the plot, or to take one of several other actions.

The prefix to the variable name depends on the graph type.
For \f1Line: Y over years\f0 and \f1Scatter: Y over X\f0, the prefix is
the case identification.  For example, \fcc2:\f0 signifies the second
case.  When the graph type is \f1Bar: Y by cases\f0 the variable name
is prefaced with the year corresponding to the displayed values.

Press \f1Next Case\f0 to display the same variable for the next
\bcasE:case\b in the list of cases.  

Press \f1Next Variable\f0 to display the next variable in the list of
variables, for the same case.

Press \f1New Choice\f0 to create another Pick Variable button.

Press \f1Write Graph\f0 to output the contents of the window to a
file (not yet implemented).

Press \f1Clear Graph\f0 to clear the graph.

Press \f1Read FVS Output\f0 to start the \lREADFVSOutput:Read FVS Output\l
window.  You can do this at any time to add new cases to the list.

Press \f1Graphs\f0 to start another Generate Graphs window.  You can

Press \f1Close\f0 to close the window.  This does not imply clearing
the cases.  

HTOPIC graphScaling "How Scaling is Done"
\fbHow Scaling is Done\f0

Designing a logical way to scale a graph that may contain disparate
data is a challenge.  Explaining it to others is both a test of the
logic and yet another challenge!

First, take the case where only one variable is being graphed or
charted.  In that case, the maximum value corresponds to the top of
the vertical axis (the Y axis).  Note that the tick marks on Y axis
range from 0.0 to 1.0.  The proportion of the maximum for the
variable is displayed (generally, the special cases are described
below).

When two variables are displayed, they each have there own maximum
value so each is displayed as a proportion of their own
maximum values (usually).  You can see what the maximum value is using the 
\lVARIABLEPicker:Pick Variable\l window.  This window can be displayed
at any time by pushing the button for the variable.

Now, consider the exceptions.  First, when a variable of the same name
is displayed twice, the maximum of the maximum is used to scale the
graph or chart.  For example, lets say that you wish to display a line
graph of basal area over years for two cases.  You would select the
basal area variable for the first case, then push the Next Case button to
display the same variable for the second case.  When you do this,
Suppose will scale the lines to the maximum over both sets of data so
that you can compare them to each other.  The same logic is used 
when making bar charts.  This logic is used for Event Monitor Compute
variables as well as variables related to other reports.  Compute
Variables are linked to each other if they have the same name or when
the name is the same up to an \fc@\f0 symbol or an apostrophe
(\fb'\f0).  See \lvariableTricks:Tricks with Event Monitor Variables\l
for more information.

The second special case relates to the need to display two different
variables using a maximum value that is global over both variables.
For example, lets say that you wish to draw a line graph of the total
cubic volume over time with another line graph of the total production
of total cubic volume over time.  A useful graph of these two
variables will link them to the same maximum so that they can be
interpreted correctly.  This linkage is done by Suppose.  

Variables form the FVS Summary Statistics table are linked
for these graphing purposes.  Total cubic volume is linked to total
production of total cubic volume, merchantable volume is linked to
total production of merchantable volume, board foot volume is linked
to total production of board foot volume, removal statistics are
linked their counterparts, and accretion is linked to mortality.  In
addition, variables that have the same units of measure are linked
(but there may be some exceptions to this rule).

The third scaling issue concerns how to handle negative values.  As
most values are zero or positive, this is not often a problem.
However, if a variable contains a negative observation, the proportion
of the total range of the variable is plotted rather than the
proportion of the maximum value.

The fourth scaling issue concerns scaling on graph type "Phase: class
level by year".  On those graphs the tick marks on the Y-axis run
from 0 to the maximum number of class levels over all variables,
regardless of the variable names.  The class level over time is drawn
for each variable.  A maximum of 20 class levels is allowed.

The fifth issues concerns scaling varialbes that are proportions or
percentages. In these cases, the maximum is set to 1.0 for proportions
and 100.0 for percentages. 

HTOPIC variableTricks "Tricks with Event Monitor Variables"
\fbTricks with Event Monitor Variable Names\f0

\bFVs:FVS\b allows you to define your own variables using the 
Compute \bkeywordS:keyword\b.  By naming the variable using the following
rules, you can get the \lGENERATEReports:Generate Reports\l and 
\lGENERATEGraphs:Generate Graphs\l windows to do important things with
the variables.

\fbBefore/After Removals: $0 and $1\f0

First, consider the case where you wish to have a single variable, say
\fcMYQMD\f0, have one value corresponding to conditions prior to removals
and another corresponding to conditions after removals are simulated
by FVS.  You need two observations for this variable in any FVS
\bcyclE:cycles\b that contains a simulated harvest.  When necessary,
Suppose automatically creates two observations for variables from the
Summary Statistics table.  For example, for total cubic volume,
Suppose creates one observation for the before removal condition and
one for the after removal condition.

You cause Suppose to consider two Compute variables to be one variable
by naming the variable with the suffix \fc$0\f0 for the before
removal condition and \fc$1\f0 for the after removal condition.  So,
if you have an expression for \fcMYQMD$0\f0 defining \fcMYQMD\f0 for
the before prior to removal condition and another expression for
\fcMYQMD$1\f0 defining the variable for the after removal condition,
Suppose will change these variable names into one variable with two
observations for each year that marks the beginning of a cycle.

\fbVariable Sets: Using an Apostrophe '\f0

Second, consider the case where you wish to create two or more Compute
variables that are treated as a set in \lGENERATEGraphs:Generate Graphs\l 
windows.  Treating the variables as a set signals common scaling in
graph type \f1Line: Y over years\f0 and causes Suppose to create a set of
observations useful for graph type \f1Bar: Y by observation tag\f0.

Creating a set of variables is done using a different suffix to a
common variable prefix.  As an example, consider a variable named
\fcVOL'PINE\f0 and another variable named \fcVOL'FIR\f0.  In this
case, the common prefix is \fcVOL\f0.  For line graphs, Suppose will
scale these two variables using the maximum value over both variables
rather than independent maximum values.  This action allows better
interpretation of the resulting graphs.

For graph type \f1Bar: Y by observation tag\f0, Suppose will generate a
variable given the prefix name--for example \fcVOL\f0--and a set of
observations each tagged with the suffix--for example \fcFIR\f0 and 
\fcPINE\f0.  When you pick this generated variable for a bar chart,
you will get one bar each for \fcFIR\f0 and \fcPINE\f0.

Note that the two approaches can be combined.  However, if you combine
them, always place the \fc$0\f0 and \fc$1\f0 suffices last.  And
remember that Compute variable names are limited to 8 characters
including these suffices.

\fbClass Variables: Using an @ Symbol\f0

Finally, note that you can use the \fb@\f0 symbol to signal that a
variable holds a class level rather than a real number.  For example,
reconsider the \fcVOL'FIR\f0 and \fcVOL'PINE\f0 variables introduced
above.  Let say that you have defined another Compute Variable called
\fcCOMP@2\f0 that has the value 1.0 when \fcVOL'PINE\f0 is larger than
\fcVOL'FIR\f0 and 2.0 otherwise.  The \fb@\f0 symbol signals to
Suppose that the variable is a class variable suitable to be displayed
when the graph type is \f1Phase: class level by year\f0 (see 
\lGENERATEGraphs:Generate Graphs\l).  It also signals special
treatment of the variable when computing average cases, see 
\lAVERAGEFVSOutput:Average FVS Output\l for more information.

The number following the @ symbol (the number 2 in this example) is
the maximum number of levels associated with the variable.  Coding it
is optional.  If it is not coded, then the largest level found in the
data is taken as the maximum possible class level.

You can use the \fc@\f0 symbol with \fc$0\f0 and \fc$1\f0 to define
the class level for before and after thinning.  If you combine them,
always place the \fc$0\f0 and \fc$1\f0 suffices last.  And
remember that Compute Variable names are limited to 8 characters
including these suffices.  Using the apostrophe together with 
the \fc@\f0 symbol is not supported.

HTOPIC READFVSOutput "Read FVS Output"
\fbRead FVS Output\f0

Read FVS Output is used to control the process of selecting
\bFVs:FVS\b output files to read.

There are 4 companion windows to this window, as follows:

\i20.-	\lGENERATEReports:Generate Reports\l window allows you to
build custom reports using data in the output files generated by
\bFVs:FVS\b.

\i20.-	\lGENERATEGraphs:Generate Graphs\l allows you to create 
line graphs and bar charts of the data generated by FVS.

\i20.-	\lAVERAGEFVSOutput:Average FVS Output\lis used to create
weighted averages of \bcasE:cases\b.

\i20.-	\lVARIABLEPicker:Pick Variable\l is used to select which
data you would like to display.

Use this window is to read the \bFVs:FVS\b output you wish to further
analyze.

The \bcasE:cases\b that have been read are listed in the list box that
makes up the body of this window. 

Use the \f1File:\f0 text box to specify the \bFVs:FVS\b output file
you want Suppose to read.  Or, use the \f1Browse\f0 button to start a
file selection dialog to pick the file you want. 

Open the list button next to \f1Browse\f0 to select the kind of file
you want to Suppose to read.  

Press \f1Read File\f0 to cause Suppose to read the specified file and
build as many \bcasE:cases\b as can be found in the file.  You can
read as many FVS files as you like.  The files do not necessarily need
to have been created using Suppose.

Press \f1Average\f0 to open the 
\lAVERAGEFVSOutput:Average FVS Output\l window.

Press \f1Stop Reading\f0 to abort the reading process that is in
progress.

Press \f1Delete Cases\f0 to delete selected cases.  If you push this
button when no cases are selected, Suppose selects all the cases.  You
must push the button a second time to actually delete them.

Deleting any cases invalidates all \lGENERATEReports:Generate Reports\l 
and \lGENERATEGraphs:Generate Graphs\l windows that are displaying
data even if the cases you are displaying are not those you are
deleting (smarter logic is not yet included in Suppose).  You are
warned and provided the opportunity to save the reports prior to
losing them.

\f1Close\f0 simply closes the window, it does not delete the cases you
have read.  Exiting Suppose or using the Delete Cases button are the
only methods of deleting the cases.

HTOPIC VARIABLEPicker "Pick Variable"
\fbPick Variable\f0

The Pick Variable window is used to select the data you would like
to display in a report or graph, display descriptive data about
variables, and delete a variable from a related report or graph.

Variables are organized in a hierarchy.  The first level is the
\bcasE:case\b, the second is the FVS report within each case.  An
example of an FVS report is the Summary Statistics Table.  Within
each report, there are a set of variables.

You pick the case, the report, and then the variable. That variable 
is then displayed in the related
\lGENERATEReports:Generate Reports\l or 
\lGENERATEGraphs:Generate Graphs\l window.

When the report type is \f1List over cases\f0 or when a graph type is 
\f1Bar: Y by cases\f0 the Case list button is not present and the
report names are prefaced with the year corresponding to the data.

Use the \f1Cases\f0 list button to select the case.

Use the \f1Reports\f0 list button to select the report.

Pick the \f1Variable\f0 from the list box.  You can double click on
the variable to both select it and close the Pick Variable window.

Press \f1Ok\f0 to accept the selected variable and close the window.

Press \f1Apply\f0 to accept the selected variable without closing the window.

Press \f1Delete\f0 to delete the related column, line, set of bars, or
set of points, from a related \lGENERATEReports:Generate Reports\l or 
\lGENERATEGraphs:Generate Graphs\l window.  This button does not
delete the variable from the list of variables in the Pick Variable
window.

Press \f1Close\f0 to close the window without taking any further
action.

When you select a variable, some descriptive information about the
variable is displayed to the right of the Variable list box.  This
information includes the units of measure (when applicable), the
number of observations, and the maximum and minimum values.  Having
access to this data allows you to better interpret the graphs (see 
\lgraphScaling:How Scaling is Done\l).

The descriptive information is generally correct.  However, for the
FVS Summary Statistics table, please note the following more exact
definitions for some variables:

\fcTCuFt\f0 - Total cubic volume (West US), Pulpwood and Sawlog cubic
volume (East US)

\fcMCuFt\f0 - Merchantable cubic volume (West US), Sawlog cubic volume
(East US)

\fcBdFt\f0 - Board foot volume (West US), Sawlog board foot volume (East US)

\fcTpTCuFt\f0 - Total production in total cubic volume (West US),
Total production in sawlog and pulpwood cubic volume (East US)

\fcTpMCuFt\f0 - Total production in merchantable cubic volume (West
US), Total production in sawlog cubic volume (East US)

\fcTpBdFt\f0 - Total production in board foot volume (West US),
Total production in sawlog board foot volume (East US)

\fcRTCuFt\f0 - Removed total cubic volume (West US), Removed sawlog
and pulpwood cubic volume (East US)

\fcRMCuFt\f0 - Removed merchantable cubic volume (West US), Removed
sawlog cubic volume (East US)

\fcRBdFt\f0 - Removed board foot volume (West US), Removed sawlog
board foot volume (East US)

HTOPIC AVERAGEFVSOutput "Average FVS Output"
\fbAverage FVS Outputs\f0

The Average FVS Output window allows you to build weighted averages 
of \bcasE:cases\b defined by reading FVS output.  

There are 4 companion windows to this window, as follows:

\i20.-	\lGENERATEReports:Generate Reports\l window allows you to
build custom reports using data in the output files generated by
\bFVs:FVS\b.

\i20.-	\lGENERATEGraphs:Generate Graphs\l allows you to create 
line graphs and bar charts of the data generated by FVS.

\i20.-	\lREADFVSOutput:Read FVS Output\l is used to select FVS output
files to read. 

\i20.-	\lVARIABLEPicker:Pick Variable\l is used to select the data
you would like to display.

The weighted avarages are computed for any report, variable, and
observations that are in common over all the cases selected for
inclusion in the wighted average.  For example, if one or more more
cases in the set do not contain a given report, then no averages are
computed for any variable in that report. This rule implies that all
variables and observations in the weighted averages have the same
sampling bases. 

Class variables (like Event Monitor variables coded with an @ symbol, 
see \lvariableTricks:Tricks with Event Monitor Variables\l) are
treated in a special way.  Rather than taking an average (which would
be meaningless), Suppose computes the sum of the sampling weight at
each class level and reports the proportion of the total weight
represented by the sum.  

For example, say that you create an Event Monitor variable name
\fcSPCLASS@\f0 that has the value 1 when a stand is classified as a
member of species class 1, the value 2 when classified as a member of
species class 2, and the value 3 when classified as a member of
species class 3. Here is some hypothetical data for 3 cases (each case
has a weighting factor of 1 for this illustration):

\n\fcYear   c1:SPCLASS@   c2:SPCLASS@   c3:SPCLASS@
1995        1             3             3
2005        2             1             2
2015        2             1             3
\w\f0

When Suppose creates an "average" case, it replaces the variable name
\fcSPCLASS@\f0 with a set of three new variables named \fcSPCLASS'1,
SPCLASS'2\f0, and \fcSPCLASS'3\f0 and reports the proportion of the
total sampling weight at each class level for each time period.  So,
in the average, these data would be reported as:  

\n\fcYear   a4:SPCLASS'1   a4:SPCLASS'2   a4:SPCLASS'3
1995    0.333333          0            0.666667
2005    0.333333        0.666667          0
2015    0.333333        0.333333       0.333333
\w\f0

The interpretation of these data is that over all cases, 33% of the
cases are classified in species class 1 for each time period.  For
species class 2, there are no cases in 1995, 67% in 2005, and 33% 
in 2015.

See \lvariableTricks:Tricks with Event Monitor Variables\l to
understand why the variable names contain the apostrophe \fc'\f0 
character and how these data can be used in a bar chart.  

Finally, note that some FVS reports contain classification
variables.  Suppose treats them as described above even though the
variable name assigned by Suppose to the variable need not contain an
@ symbol.

The elements of the Average FVS Output window are described below:

There is an upper list box that shows the cases that are currently
defined and a lower list box that shows the groups represented by
those cases (this list of groups is not the same list defined for the
current run and displayed on the\lMAINWINWindow:Selections\l window).

Press \f1Average Selected Cases\f0 to compute a weighted average of the
cases you have selected in the Cases list box.

Press \f1Average Selected Groups\f0 to compute a weighted average for
each group you have selected in the Groups list box.  The cases that
are in the weighted average are all those that contain the group.  One
weighted avarage is computed for each selected group.

Press \f1Read FVS Output\f0 to open the 
\lREADFVSOutput:Read FVS Output\l window. 

Press \f1Reset\f0 to deselect all cases and groups.

Press \f1Close\f0 to close the window without taking any further
action.
