HTOPIC POSTPWINWindow "Select Post Processors" post-processors
\fbSelect Post Processors\f0

Use the Select Post Processors window to select one or more 
\bpostproC:post processors\b to add to the simulation.  You can also delete 
post processors that have already been added.

There are three list boxes in this window.  The first lists the post 
processors that can be added to a simulation, the second lists those that have 
been added, and the third contains descriptive text describing a selected 
processor.  

Use the mouse to select an available post processor you may be interested in 
using.  A single mouse click will cause Suppose to display the descriptive 
information in the bottom box but will not add the processor to the 
simulation.  To add the desired processor, either double click the mouse on 
the desired post processor or use the \f1Include\f0 button at the bottom of 
the window. 

If a post processor is in the list of those included, you can display the 
descriptive information about it by selecting it with the mouse.  You must use 
the \f1Delete\f0 button to remove an included post processor from this list.

The list of available processors may not contain some processors you noticed 
while using suppose on a different platform.  Some run only on Unix and others 
only on DOS.  Suppose only displays those processors that are available for 
the platform you are using.  

\f1Close\f0 will close this window.  Note that this window need not be
closed to proceed with building the simulation.
