\fbIntroduction to Suppose\f0

Suppose is a computer program that makes it easy to simulate the
changes in forest vegetation over a long time span and over a
"landscape" spatial scope.  By a long time span, we mean 100-400
years.  A landscape is defined to be 1 to about 1,000 forest stands.

Suppose accomplishes the simulation by creating an input file used by
\bFVs:FVS\b and by then starting the appropriate FVS \bprograM:program\b
that reads and processes the input file.  The program contains the
desired geographic \bvarianT:variant\b, and \bextenS:extensions\b to
the base FVS system.  FVS, and not Suppose, actually accomplishes 
the desired simulation.  The input file is called a 
\bsimfilE:simulation file\b.  

Suppose provides access to \bstanD:stand\b and \btreedatA:tree data\b and is
capable of editing the \bsimfilE:simulation file\b it creates using
the same tools used to create the files.

Version 1 does not contain all features planned for Suppose.  What
you are using today is a work in progress!

\fbSuppose Background\f0

The USDA Forest Service, the State of Washington Department of Natural
Resources, British Columbia Ministry of Forests,
and several state, university, and private organizations, use a
system of computer models to simulate changes in vegetation over time
given various management alternatives.  This system of models, now
called the Forest Vegetation Simulator (\bFVs:FVS\b), is based on the
\bFVs:Prognosis Model\b (Stage 1973; Wykoff et al. 1982; Wykoff 1986;
Crookston 1990; Ferguson and Crookston 1991) and other models that
have been adapted for FVS.  These other models include TWIGS
(Miner 1988), NE-TWIGS (Hilt and Teck 1989), and GENGYM (Edminster et
al. 1991) (see \lreferenceS:References\l).

The time scale of the simulations varies from 0 years to 400 years and
the spatial scale is normally one forest stand, between 2 and 50
hectares (4 to 100 acres).  Recently, a strong interest in increasing
the spatial scope to include landscapes, contiguous areas of several
to 1,000 stands, has grown into a fundamental requirement of forest
vegetation simulations.  The Parallel Processing Extension to the
Prognosis Model (Crookston and Stage 1991) represents this expanded
spatial scale.  

The primary capability of the models, and their only universal
capability, is to simulate the changes in the trees that make up
forest stands.  The simulations can represent changes due to managing
trees by thinning, adding fertilizer, and other management actions.
Secondary capabilities include the ability to represent the dynamics
of pest damage coupled with the subsequent effects on tree growth, and
the ability to represent growth and development of shrubs, grasses,
and forbs.  

FVS system components are controlled by a \bkeywordS:keyword\b command
system.  The advantage of the keyword system is that the input is a
simple ASCII-character file that serves to document and control the
simulations.  The disadvantages are that users must learn the
commands, the command formats, and the complicated strategies needed
to achieve desired results.  Very complicated keyword files are
routinely created by practiced resource professionals.  

The role of Suppose is to support forest resource specialists who do not 
have the opportunity to develop a detailed familiarity with FVS, however 
much they might depend upon its output.  Suppose is designed
to reduce the amount of detailed FVS command knowledge needed to 
make full use of FVS.  In addition, Suppose will aid 
expert FVS users by simplifying and automating tasks they now must do 
by hand or by ad-hoc automated means.  

Suppose users should be able to use most features of FVS without first
learning the FVS keyword system.  In addition, FVS users that know the
keyword system and wish to take advantage of FVS features not
otherwise supported by Suppose should have direct access to them.  In
other words: Suppose must help and not hinder users, whether novice or
expert.

\fbBasic Operation\f0

Operation of Suppose follows these basic steps:

\i20.- 	Specify the \bspacescopE:spatial scope\b of a simulation by
picking which \bstanD:stands\b you wish to include. This task is
accomplished using the 
\lSELECTSIWindow:Select Simulations Stands\l button.

\i20.	See the descriptions of the \lvegdatA:vegetation data\l and the
\llocationsFile:locations file\l for information on how Suppose knows
which stands are available for your use.  If you do not have a
locations file, you can not use Suppose.  However, you can use the 
\lRUNTUTORIAL:tutorial\l because it will build a simple locations file
for you.

\i20.-	Once you have selected stands, you may run the simulation by 
pressing the \lRUNSimulation:Run Simulation\l button on the main 
selections window.

\i20.	 Prior to running the simulation you may wish to set the time
scale, sepecify management, or take other actions you desire to
include in the simulation.  Some of these potential actions are listed
below, all actions are optional except picking stands and using the
run simulation button.

\i20.-	 Specify the \btimescopE:temporal scope\b of a simulation by
setting the ending year of the projection.  This is done using the 
\lTIMESCALWindow:Set Time Scale\l button.

\i20.-	Specify the \lCMNGWINWindow:management actions\l you
want to simulate by selection actions from the management actions.  

\i20.    When you have more that one stand in the simulation, you may
wish to specify different management actions for each group of stands or for
each stand in your run.  To accomplish this task, you must select either the 
"Current Group" or "Current Stand" radio button on the Selections 
window and then select a group or stand from the list found to the
right of these two radio buttons prior to specifying management actions.

Suppose features available on the main Selections window are also
available from the "Basics" menu item.  Additional features are
accessed using the "Extras" menu item.  Features that control Suppose
itself, rather than the characteristics of the simulation, are found
under the Options menu.  See \lMENUbar:menus\l for more information.

Run the \lRUNTUTORIAL:tutorial\l to gain some practical 
experience using Suppose.

See \lfileS:suppose files\l for information on the inputs and outputs
of Suppose and their relationship to \bFVs:FVS\b.

See \lvegdatA:Vegetation Data\l for an overview of the data used by
Suppose and FVS.

\fbVegetation Data Used by FVS and Suppose\f0

There are three kinds of data used by Suppose and FVS.

\i20.1.	Tree-level inventory data.  These data are often held in a
series of flat files but are more recently being held in data bases.
These data are converted from whatever form they are stored in to a
format that Suppose and FVS can use.  This conversion is done with
\btranslatoR:translators\b.  

\i20.2.	Stand-level inventory.  These data are sometimes held in the
same flat files as the tree-level data and more often held in separate
data bases or flat files.  As done with the tree-level data, these
data are processed by the \btranslatoR:translators\b into data called
\lstandlistFile:stand list files\l. 

\i20.3.	Spatial data.  These data are not currently being used. 
They are in GIS systems and will be needed by the Parallel Processing 
Extension (PPE).

Suppose uses a data base that stores tree- and stand-level data in a
format that can created and edited using a standard text editor.  This
data base is implemented using a set of flat files.  While other
bases may be built in the future, only the flat file structure is
available in Version 1.

The first element of the Suppose database is the
\llocationsFile:locations file\l.  This file contains one record for
each set of stand data.  For example, a set of stand data may consist of 
all of the stands on a given map.  The name of the set, called the
location name, could be the name of the map.  Besides the location
name, a set of stand data will have a common data translation method
and will be related to another file containing a list of stands.  The data
translation may be done using \btranslatoR:translators\b.  

The list of stands are stored in \lstandlistFile:stand list file(s)\l.
The tree-level data will be stored in FVS ready format in separate
flat files which have exactly the same format currently read by FVS.
Necessary information in addition to the information in the stand list
file and individual tree data files are stored in
\baddfilE:addfiles\b.  The names of these addfiles are data elements
in the stand list file.

Addfiles can also be associated with stands using the stand group
codes.  This is done using the separate data records in the locations
file.

The \llocationsFile:locations file\l can be edited using the 
\lEDITLOCSWindow:Edit Locations File\l window.

The \lstandlistFile:stand list file(s)\l can be edited using the 
\lEDITSLFWindow:Edit Stand List File\l window.

The \lFVSTREEDATA:tree data\l can also be entered or edited using the 
\lEDITFVSTWindow:Edit FVS Tree Data File\l window.

See \lfileS:suppose files\l for more information.
