\fbPlanting and Natural Regeneration\f0

This window is used to specify planting and natural regeneration
options.

Use the text box at the top of this window to change the name of the 
component if you want a different name than that presented as a default.

Use the elements of the scrolling part of the window to set the
parameters of the planting or natural regeneration.  

The elements of the window are different depending on the capabilities
of the \bprograM:FVS program\b you are using. Those elements are noted
on a case by case basis.

Set \f1Sprouting Yes/No\f0 to control the use of the sprouting logic.
This control is present only for \bvarianT:variants\b that contain
sprouting species. 

Set \f1In Growth Yes/No\f0 to control the in growth logic of the Full
Establishment Model of the sprouting logic.  When the Partial
Establishment Model is being used, this control is not present.

Set the \f1Date of disturbance\f0 using the scheduling box.  The year
specified, or the year the condition is true, is taken by the model as
the date of disturbance.  This date is used to compute the amount of 
regeneration you will have when using the Full Establishment
Model.  In any case, it is used to set the site preparation and
planting dates described below.  For information about how to schedule
the options, see \lSCHEDOBJSubview:Scheduling Actions by Year or Condition\l

Set the \f1StockAdj\f0 value to zero or to a number you specify.
StockAdj is only used with the Full Establishment Model to adjust the
probability stocking upward (numbers over 1.0) or downward (numbers
less than 1.0).

Set the \f1Site preparation\f0 timing and methods using the text edit
boxes.  Again, these elements are only displayed if you are using the Full
Establishment Model.  If you leave the percentages blank, the
model predicts average percentages.

Set the number of years after the disturbance for
\f1Planting/Natural\f0 activities.  The same year will be used of all
the planting/natural activities that follow.

Specify as many \f1Planting/Natural\f0 activities as you desire.  Set the
parameters of each in the text boxes grouped together by a box.  You
must specify a \f1Species\f0 to plant or naturally establish and the
\f1Trees/acre\f0.  You can optionally modify or specify the remaining
parameters.

Press \f1Ok\f0 to accept the selections and close the window.  

Press \f1Another Plant/Natural\f0 to create an additional planting or
natural regeneration box.  You can create as many as you wish, each
will result in an additional planting or natural establishment activity.

Press \f1Reset\f0 to reset the window to the state it was in when it
was opened.

Press \f1Cancel\f0 to close the window without creating a component
(or without saving changes to a component you are editing).

Use the \f1Extras\f0 menu and the \f1View Component Keywords\f0 item
if you want to view the FVS keywords generated for the component.
