\fbThin From Above or Below\f0

This window is used to schedule a thinning from either above or below.
It is found under the Even-aged:Thinning action.

Use the text box at the top of this window to change the name of the
component if you want a different name than that presented as a default.

Use the elements of the scrolling part of the window to set the
parameters of the thinning.  

For information about how to schedule the thinning, see
\lSCHEDOBJSubview:Scheduling Actions by Year or Condition\l

Use the radio buttons to select the residual density of the thinning.
If you select trees per acre (hactare), then the horizontal slidebars
for the density metric and the spacing metrics are linked.

You can select to hold as a residual a percentage of trees or basal
rather than specify a specific amount.

The thinning applies only to the range of trees that are within the
diameter and heigth limits specified using the last four horizontal
slide bars.  That is, FVS computes the residual density for the trees
within these limits, not for the stand as a whole.

Press \f1Ok\f0 to accept the selections and close the window.  

Press \f1Reset\f0 to reset the window to the state it was in when it
was opened.

Press \f1Cancel\f0 to close the window without creating a component
(or without saving changes to a component you are editing).

Use the \f1Extras\f0 menu and the \f1View Component Keywords\f0 item
if you want to view the FVS keywords generated for the component.
