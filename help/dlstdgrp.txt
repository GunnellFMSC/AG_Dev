HTOPIC DELETEStandWindow "Delete Stand(s)" stand delete
\fbDelete Stand(s)\f0

Use this window to delete a \bstanD:stand\b.  

This window is accessed from the Extras menu.

From the \f1Delete stand\f0 list box, select the stand(s) you wish
to delete.  Multiple stands can be selected by using the Shift key
to select a range of stands or Ctrl key to select/deselect individual
stands.

Once a stand is selected, the \bcomponenT:components\b
that are directly attached to the stand are listed in the list box
labeled \f1And these attached components\f0.  As expected, deleting
the stand will also delete the listed components.

Press \f1Delete\f0 to actually delete the stand.

Repeat the process of selecting and deleting stands, if you so desire.

Press \f1Close\f0 to close the window.

Note that if you delete any stand, and if any stand is set as the
\lCURRENTRadioGroup:current stand\l, then the last stand in the list
of all stands is set to be the current stand.  If you delete all stands,
then the first \bgroupCode:group\b in the list of all groups will 
become the current group.

Items selected for deletion are only removed from the simulation and
are not applied to the underlying data.

HTOPIC DELETEGroupWindow "Delete Group(s)" group delete
\fbDelete Group(s)\f0

Use this window to delete a \bgroupCode:group\b.  

This window is accessed from the Extras menu.

From the \f1Delete group\f0 list box, select the group(s) you wish
to delete.  Multiple groups can be selected by using the Shift key
to select a range of groups or Ctrl key to select/deselect individual
groups.

Once a group is selected, the \bcomponenT:components\b
that are directly attached to the group are listed in the list box
labeled \f1And these attached components\f0.  As expected, deleting
the group will also delete the listed components.

Press \f1Delete\f0 to actually delete the group.

Repeat the process of selecting and deleting groups, if you so desire.

Press \f1Close\f0 to close the window.

Note that if you delete a group that is set to be the
\lCURRENTRadioGroup:current group\l, then the first
\bgroupCode:group\b in the list of groups will become the current
group.  

Suppose does not allow you to delete all the groups.  It is generally
very unwise to delete group \f1All\f0.

Items selected for deletion are only removed from the simulation and
are not applied to the underlying data.
