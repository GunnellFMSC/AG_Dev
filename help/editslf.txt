\fbEdit Stand List File\f0

The Edit Stand List File window supports the process of editing a
\lstandlistFile:Stand List File\l.  It can also be used to convert an
old style FVS Submittal System \fc.dir\f0 file to a stand list file
and to add a values to all records in a file when the values are not
defined (see the \f1Template\f0 feature described near the end of this
help text).  

An overview of the \lvegdatA:vegetation data used by Suppose\l 
is available.

Note that this window does not support an undo feature.  Press
\f1Cancel\f0 to close the window without saving any changes to the
currently loaded file.

Changes made to a Stand List File are not available in the 
\lSELECTSIWindow:Select Simulation Stands\l window until after the
file is saved and the Select Simulation Stands window is opened (or
reopened).  If you are creating a new Stand List File, you must add
its name to the \llocationsFile:Locations File\l before the stands it
lists are available in the Select Simulation Stands window.

Press the \f1Browse\f0 button to select a Stand List File or type the
desired file name in the text box and press the return key.  You can
not specify a FVS Submittal System \fc.dir\f0 file using this button
(see the \f1Import\f0 feature described near the end of this
help text). 

Note that this window does not distinguish between the various record
types of the \lstandlistFile:Stand List File\l so you need not worry
about them.  In this window, a record is defined to be the entry for a
stand inclusive of all the physical record types and data.

To access a given record, enter the record number in the text box and
press the enter key.

Press \f1\<\<Prev\f0 or \f1Next\>\>\f0 to navigate through the
records.

Enter a desired stand identification in the text box on the right hand
side of the \f1Find:\f0 button to search for a given stand.  Press
\f1Find:\f0 button or the enter key to accomplish the desired search.

Press \f1New\f0 to insert a blank record (or a copy of the
\f1Template\f0 as described near the end of this help text) after
the current record.

Press \f1Delete\f0 to delete the current record.

Press \f1Duplicate\f0 to duplicate the current record, placing the
duplicate after the current record.

A scrolling box is provided to display and change the stand-level
data associated with each record.  Note these important facts
regarding the fields within the scrolling box.

\i20.1.	Use the text boxes to change values.  Use the \f1Enter Key\f0
on your keyboard to navigate between text boxes or use your mouse.

\i20.2.	A list button is supplied when a coded value has a
corresponding definition.  The values in the list box may depend on
the first FVS \bvarianT:variant\b specified in the FVS variant(s) text
box.  Changing the FVS variant will cause the contents of the list
buttons to change.

\i20.3.	The value in the text box is the value used regardless of any
data displayed in a corresponding list button.  

\i20.4.	If a text box value is blank Suppose outputs an \fc@\f0 sign
for the field to indicate the value is unknown (blanks are distinctly
different from zeros).

\i20.5.	\f1Browse\f0 buttons can be used to select a file name for
the text boxes that require one.  

\i20.6.	See \lstandlistFile:Stand List File\l description for more
information.

Press \f1Ok\f0 to save the current file and close the window.

Press \f1Save\f0 to save the current file without closing the window.

Press \f1Save As\f0 to save the current data with a different file
name without closing the window.

Press \f1Template\f0 to set the current record as a template, or to
unset the template if one is already set.  You can set, unset, and set
again the template by pressing the button repeatedly.  Note these
characteristics of using templates:

\i20.1.	When a file is read, or imported, values that are not defined
in the read or imported file are given the values found in the
template.  An important use of his feature is to supply a variant
identification and location code to imported records (see the
\f1Import\f0 feature described below).  

\i20.2.	When the \f1New\f0 button is pushed, the template is used to
supply the new record.

Press \f1Import\f0 to import a \fc.dir\f0 used by the FVS Submittal
System.  You can use this feature to import, then save these files so
that the data can be used in Suppose.  When a file is imported, the
file name text box found at the top of the window is loaded with the
file imported file's name and the suffix \fc.slf\f0.

Follow these steps to import a file using the template feature:

\i20.1.	Set the FVS variant(s) text box to the variant(s) to which the
data you intend to import applies.

\i20.2.	Set the Location code text box for the location code (usually a
code corresponding to a National Forest) you want specified for all
the records you want imported.

\i20.3.	Set the \bgroupCode:group codes\b you want for each stand.
The codes you enter will be appended to those found the imported
\fc.dir\f0 file.  Do the same for \baddfilE:addfiles\b as they follow
the same rules.

\i20.4.	Set all other fields to values you want to use for all records
when the fields are not defined (blank or not present in the imported 
\fc.dir\f0 file).

\i20.5.	Press \f1Template\f0 to set the template.

\i20.6.	Press \f1Import\f0, select the file you want to import, and
press \f1Ok\f0 on the file selection dialog.

\i20.7.	Press \f1Save\f0 to save the data as an \fc.slf\f0 file.

Use the \lEDITLOCSWindow:Edit Locations File\l window to add newly
created stand list files and corresponding location names to your
locations file.  Then you can include the stands in a simulation 
using the \lSELECTSIWindow:Select Simulation Stands\l window.

Press \f1Cancel\f0 to close the window without saving the data.  Note
that this is the only way to avoid saving the changes you have made.
