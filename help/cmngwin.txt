HTOPIC CMNGWINWindow  "Management Actions" management_actions 
\fbManagement Actions Window\f0

There are two lists in the Management Actions window.  The first list
is a set of categories of actions.  When you select one of the
categories, the second list is filled with actions within the selected
category.  Selection of an action in the second list causes Suppose to
start the window that is used to set up the management action.

Many of the management actions windows have help entries of their
own.  However, some management actions are supported directly with FVS
keyword entry windows.  For those window, read the instructions at the
bottom of the scrollable area of the keyword entry screen.

Suppose limits the list of categories and management actions to those
that the can be run using the FVS \bprograM:program\b being used.
Therefore, the list of available actions will vary depending on the
\bvarianT:variant\b and \bextenS:extensions\b available in the
program.  Furthermore, this list may change as you make selections.
That is, the selection of one option may result in Suppose eliminating
other selections.
