\fbFVS Keyword Entry Windows\f0

This window is used to specify the settings for most keywords.  It is
a general purpose window, so specific help regarding each of its
elements is not available.

Use the \f1text box\f0 at the top of this window to change the name of the 
component if you want a different name than that presented as a default.

The elements of a keyword are displayed in the \f1scrolling region\f0
that makes up the body of the window.  You can scroll through the
elements modifying them as you go.

In most all of the keyword windows, there is a \f1description\f0 found below
the last keyword element inside the scrolling region.  This
description often contains usage notes and additional instructions.

In many of of the keyword windows, you will find an option that allows
you to \lSCHEDOBJSubview:schedule actions by year or condition\l.
This element is typical of many management windows as well.

Press \f1Ok\f0 to accept the selections and close the window.  

Press \f1Use Parms\f0, if it is activated, to transfer the keyword to the 
window used to \lEXPRESSWindow:edit expressions\l.  This button is
activated if the keyword is one that allows you to enter expressions
rather than constants for the keyword parameter fields.  The transfer
is done using the setting you have already made in the scrolling
region of the window.  A good approach is to make all the settings you
want to keep as constants using the elements of the scrolling window.

Press \f1Reset\f0 to reset the window to the state it was in when it
was opened.

Press \f1Cancel\f0 to close the window without creating a component
(or without saving changes to a component you are editing).

Use the \f1Extras\f0 menu and the \f1View Component Keywords\f0 item
if you want to view the FVS keywords generated for the component.
