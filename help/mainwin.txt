HTOPIC MAINWINWindow "Selections" selections
\fbSelections\f0

This window provides access to all of the basic Suppose functions
plus it displays the name of the simulation file, the number of
\bstanD:stands\b and \bgroupCode:groups\b in the simulation,
and the group or stand that is \lCURRENTRadioGroup:current\l.

Additional features of Suppose are accessed using menu items.  Press
on this hot link to view help on all menus: \lMENUbar:The Menus.\l

See \loperatioN:Basic Operation\l for an overview of how to use Suppose.

Each element of the Selections window has an associated 
context-sensitive help topic.  Use context sensitve help feature 
or go to the \lXVT_TPC_CONTENTS:Table of Contents\l to pick the item
you wish to view.

HTOPIC SELECTEcosystemButton "Select Ecosystem Components"
\fbSelect Ecosystem Components\f1 -- a planned feature\f0

When complete, this feature will allow you to select from a list of
ecosystem components that have been modeled for your geographic area.
For example, if you wish to represent root disease or fires in your
simulation, and if there are \bFVs:FVS\b \bextenS:extensions\b
available that represent these components, then you will be able to
select them.  Management actions that apply to those extensions will
then be available from the \lCMNGWINWindow:Management Actions\l
window.

Furthermore, the lists in this window will be coordinated with those
presented in under \lSELECTModelOutputButton:Select Model Outputs\l.

HTOPIC SELECTModelOutputButton "Select Model Outputs"
\fbSelect Model Outputs\f1 -- a planned feature\f0

When complete, this feature will allow you to select from a list of
model outputs that are optionally available for the simulation.
Requesting a specific model output might imply the selection of a
specific \bFVs:FVS\b \bextenS:extensions\b that represents an ecosystem
component that is not represented in the base model.  In this way,
selecting model outputs and the 
\lSELECTEcosystemButton:Select Ecosystem Components\l features are
coordinated. 

HTOPIC  SPECIFYModelModButton "Specify Model Modifiers"
\fbSpecify Model Modifiers\f1 -- a planned feature\f0

You can modify behavior of many \bFVs:FVS\b submodels, such as the diameter
increment submodel.  This planned feature will provide a graphic
interface to the tools used to modify model behavior.  

The ability to make such modifications is justified for at least two
reasons.  First, FVS may be known to contain a consistent or systematic
bias for your conditions.  If you understand and have measurements for
this bias, you can include those measurements in the simulation using
the model modifiers.  Second, some ecosystem components, or
biophysical processes, may be operating in your area that are not
represented by FVS.  For example, you may have winds that cause top
damage.  This condition is not directly represented by FVS, but there
are model modifiers that allow you to represent this condition.

HTOPIC  RUNSimulation "Run Simulation"
\fbRun Simulation\f0

When you press this button, Suppose does the following:

Picks an \bFVs:FVS\b \bvarianT:variant\b for the simulation.

Picks an FVS \bprograM:program\b that contains the variant and any
\bextenS:extensions\b you are using.

Picks an FVS \bcommanD:command\b that will run the program on the
operating system you are using.  

Insures that the \bsimfilE:simulation file\b is saved.  If it is not
saved, you will be asked if it is ok to save.

If you are using Windows, a batch file is created to run the
simulation and any post processors you have selected.  The name of the
batch file will be formed by taking the simulation file name, removing
the suffix (\fc.key\f0) and adding the suffix \fc.bat\f0.  For
example, if your simulation file is named \fcjohnson.key\f0, the batch
file will be named \fcjohnson.bat\f0.

If you are using Unix, a shell script is created to run the
simulation and any post processors you have selected.  The name of the
script file will be formed by taking the simulation file name, removing
the suffix (\fc.key\f0) and adding the suffix \fc.sh\f0.  For
example, if your simulation file is named \fcjohnson.key\f0, the script
file will be named \fcjohnson.sh\f0.
 
You are asked if Suppose may actually submit the batch file or shell
script for processing.  You may Run or Cancel.  If you Run, the
simulation will start, if you Cancel, you make other selections.  In
either case, the batch file or shell script will be created and may be
run later from the operating system command line.

HTOPIC SIMULATIONFile "Simulation File"
\fbSimulation File\f0

A simulation file is a computer data file which contains FVS
\bkrecordS:keyword records\b and data used directly by Suppose.

Simulation files have the file name suffix \fc.key\f0. 

You can open an existing file by pulling down the File menu item and
selecting the \f1Open\f0 option. 

You can also open a file by specifying the file name on the 
\lcommandLine:command line\l used to start Suppose.

You can start a new simulation file by selecting the 
\f1New\f0 option under the File menu.

The file name \fb*new file*\f0 indicates that you have not specified a
simulation file name, or that you used the \f1New\f0 file menu item.

HTOPIC  CURRENTRadioGroup "Current Group or Stand"  current group stand 
\fbCurrent Group or Stand\f0

When you create a \bcomponenT:component\b in Suppose it is added to
the current \bstanD:stand\b or \bgroupCode:group\b.  You use the 
Current Group or Current Stand radio buttons on the 
\lMAINWINWindow:selections window\l to tell Suppose that you
want newly created components to be added to a group or a stand.  You
use the list button found to the right of the radio buttons to select
which group or which stand.

For example, say you have three stands in a run and you wish
to add a thinning management action to the first stand and not to the
others.  To insure that the thinning is added to the desired stand,
you must first select Current Stand, then use the list button to
select the desired stand from the list of 3 stands in the simulation.

Here is another example.  Say you have 10 stands in the simulation and
you want to simulate a shelterwood harvest in 5 of the stands.
Furthermore, the 5 stands are all in a single group named \f1Timber\f0
(they may also be in other groups and they will be in the group \f1All\f0).
Adding a shelterwood harvest to each of the 5 stands can be
accomplished in 2 different ways.  A good way is to select Current Group
and pick the \f1Timber\f0 group using the list button.  Then use the
Management Actions button, select, and create the shelterwood 
\bcomponenT:component\b.  You need only create one shelterwood
component as it will be part of the group and each stand in the group
will receive a copy of the shelterwood when the simulation file is
created by Suppose.  If you wish to modify the shelterwood, you have
only to modify it once as it will apply to each of the members of the
group.

Another way to add a shelterwood harvest to each of the 5 stands is to
use the Current Stand option, select the first of the 5 stands, create
the shelterwood for the first stand and then repeat this sequence of
actions for each of the 5 stands.  This approach will allow you to
customize the shelterwood for each of the 5 stands but it also
requires you to repeat the sequence several times.

Using the Group approach is best for simulations involving large
numbers of stands, or in the case where you are sure you want the
component to be added to most, or perhaps \f1All\f0 of the stands.
This is often the case when selecting an Output option or a model
modifier.

Using the Stand approach is best when you are running 2 or 3 stands
and you need to greatly customize the components for the individual
stands.  

When you are running just 1 stand, it makes no difference
which approach you use because Group \f1All\f0 is the default group
and your 1 stand is part of that group.

HTOPIC EXITButton "Exit"
\fbExit\f0

Exit will terminate Suppose.  If you have not saved a modified
\bsimfilE:simulation file\b, you will first be asked if you so desire.
