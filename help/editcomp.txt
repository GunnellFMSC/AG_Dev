HTOPIC  EDITSimulationFile "Edit Simulation File" edit component insert delete
\fbEdit Simulation\f0

The major purpose of this window is to provide you with a list of the
\bcomponenT:components\b in a simulation and to allow you to edit or
modify those components.  Secondary purposes include deleting, cutting,
pasting, writing to a file, and inserting components from a file. You
can also select a \bstanD:stand\b or \bgroupCode:group\b to delete.

The components are listed in the order they will appear in the
simulation file. Nesting within stands and conditions is shown using a
tree structure. A single component is listed more than once if it is
part of a group that contains more than one stand. If you select one
of these components, it will show as selected each place it
appears. The list of stands that would be affected by editing a
component is displayed in the "Affected Stands" list located on the
right hand side of the window.

Right-clicking any \bstanD:stand\b or \bgroupCode:group\b will make
that item \lCURRENTRadioGroup:current\l. The current \bstanD:stand\b
or \bgroupCode:group\b is noted by its red font.

To \f1edit\f0 a component, double-click it or select it and press the
Edit Selection button found at the bottom of the window.

To \f1cut\f0 a component from the list, and place it in the
\f1paste\f0 space, press the Cut button.

To \f1copy\f0 a component to the paste space, press the Copy button.

To \f1delete\f0 a component, select it and press the Delete button or 
the Delete key on the keyboard. If a stand or group is selected, the
\lDELETEStandWindow:Delete Stand\l or \lDELETEGroupWindow:Delete Group\l
window is opened.

To \f1paste\f0 a component from the paste space, press the Paste
button.  To understand where the component will be pasted, see the
description below on Inserting from a file.

The Cut, Copy and Paste features can also be accessed through standard
menu short cuts, i.e. Ctrl+X for Cut, Ctrl+C for Copy and Ctrl+V for
Paste.

To \f1write\f0 a component to a file for future use in another run,
press the Write button (or the Append button if you want the component
to be appended to an existing file).  When you use this feature, a file open
dialog will appear asking you to specify a file name.  By convention,
use the file suffix \fc.kcp\f0 for these "keyword component files".

To \f1insert\f0 one or more components from a file, press the Insert
from file button.

When you insert a component from a file, or if you paste a component,
Suppose will select the placement location.  You can control the exact
placement by selecting an existing component in the component list
prior to doing the paste or insert operation.  In this case, Suppose
will ask you if you wish the inserted component to be placed before,
after, or according to placement rules Suppose contains.  If you do the
insert or paste operation without any components selected, Suppose
will use the placement rules automatically.

The placement rules account for the ordering of components as required
by FVS.  For example, if a component is predicated on a condition,
then the placement must be placed after the condition.  In fact, it is
placed directly after the last component that is predicated on the
same condition.  If a component is related to an FVS
\bextenS:extension\b, then it is (usually) placed after the last
component that is part of the same extension.  

The placement rules dictate that a component is added to the 
\lCURRENTRadioGroup:current group or stand\l (set on the 
\lMAINWINWindow:Selections\l window).  If you have selected a group or 
stand, the component is added to that group or stand.

A file of several components can be inserted.  When this is done,
Suppose treats the components as a related collection.  It uses the
insertion rules to place the first component, and then places each of
the following components from the file after the first component in
their order of occurrence.
