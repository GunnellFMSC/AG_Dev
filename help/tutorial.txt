The best way to access the tutorial is to use the Help menu found on a
Suppose window.  Access to the tutorial using that menu item will
first insure that data referred to in the tutorial are installed in 
your working directory and second that you will be starting with a
new file.  If you are returning to the tutorial to complete some
tutorial tasks, first reinstall the tutorial data.

Select the Help menu, and the Tutorial item!  \f1Use Help menu item

\fbThis Tutorial\f0

The purposes of this tutorial are to 1) introduce Suppose functions
and strategies for use, and 2) to give you experience using Suppose
and \bFVs:FVS\b.

Most of the tutorial does not assume that you are familiar
with FVS.  However your use of some advanced features of Suppose
requires that you are familiar with corresponding FVS features.  
Those cases are noted.

Tasks in this tutorial use sample data loaded into the current
directory when you answered "Ok" to the screen that asked to load
tutorial data into the working directory.  If you did not load these
data upon starting the tutorial, do so now by restarting the tutorial
through the Help option on the Suppose menu bar (not the menu bar on
the help viewer).  The sample data that will be loaded is dependent
upon whether you are using an eastern or a western variant.  The
tutorial for eastern users needs to be run with the Lake States
variant, the tutorial for western users needs to be run with the
Inland Empire or Kookantl variants.

Topics covered include selecting stand data, selecting and
altering the contents of a simulation, running simulations, and using
tools designed to view the simulation results.

Suppose allows you to run one or many stands in a single simulation.
Some Suppose features are designed specifically for the construction
of simulations that contain many stands.  Since there are features
common to running one or many stands, those features are covered in
the first two tasks using a single stand example for simplicity.
Features used in multistand simulations are introduced in Task 3.
Whether simulating one or many stands, all of the Suppose tools are
always active and may be employed in many ways to achieve your
objectives.

The tutorial does not provide you with a complete "tour" of Suppose as
only key elements are treated.  You are encouraged to explore and
experiment on your own.

The tasks in this tutorial are:

\i20.\fbTask 1.\f0	 Create a \bsimfilE:simulation file\b for a
single stand

\i20.\fbTask 2.\f0	 Alter simulation file created in Task 1

\i20.\fbTask 3.\f0	 Set up a 6 stand run

\i20.\fbTask 4.\f0	 Explore advanced features of Suppose

If you have FVS loaded on your computer, tutorial simulations can be
run and output from these tasks can be viewed on screen or printed out
for comparison.

To complete the tutorial, move this window to an unoccupied portion of
your screen and follow the steps within each task on the Suppose
window that appears.  If your screen is not large enough to
accommodate both windows, print out the tutorial and close the
window, working on the Suppose window as you read along.

To print the tutorial, use the File menu item on the Help
window, select Print.  If you wish, you can set up the printer
first.  On Unix, the help file will be "printed" to file
\fc/tmp/suppose.ps\f0 and can be subsequently printed on a PostScript
printer.  On Windows, the file will be printed using standard Windows
printing methods.

Each task is presented in a separate help topic file (due to a limit
on the size of help files on Windows systems).  You can access each
task as follows:

HTOPIC TutorialTask1 "Creating and running a simulation" Tutorial
\fbTask 1. Creating and running a simulation\f0

This task demonstrates how to initiate a simulation by selecting data,
changing the default length of the simulation, running FVS, creating 
an output file, and making a graph of the results.

\fb1.\f0	The first step in this task is to access stand data from
which one stand among a list of available stands will be added to the
simulation.

Some information on the current simulation is displayed on the lower
portion of the \bselecTW:Selections\b window.  This information
includes the facts that you have a new simulation file containing no
stands and one group called "All".  In addition, the radio buttons
(either-or buttons) indicate that Suppose is being run in a mode
oriented toward groups of stands (see the "Current Group" radio button
located just above the Exit button on the Selections window), rather
than a mode oriented toward individual stands (see the "Current Stand"
radio button).  The significance of this setting will be evident in
Task 3. For now, leave the setting as it is.

\i20.\fb-\f0	Find and press the "Select Simulation Stands" button on
the Suppose \bselecTW:Selections\b window.  A new window will appear.

\fb2.\f0	The second step is to pick stand 3000017 from a list
of available stands and add it into the simulation.  This stand is at
location "Lake Gillette" and is in group "Timber".

\i20.\fb-\f0	Select "Lake Gillette" by clicking on that location.

\i20.\fb-\f0	Select "Timber" by clicking on that group.

\i20.\fb-\f0	Select stand 3000017 by clicking the mouse button on the
stand number in the Available Stands list.  Notice that the stand
number is then displayed in the "Desired Stand" box below the
Available Stands list.

\i20.\fb-\f0	Press the "Add 1 Stand" button at the bottom left-hand
corner of the window.  This loads the stand data for the selected
stand into the simulation.  Note that the caption "Contents: 1 Stand,
2 Groups" indicates that the simulation contains one stand and two
groups.  In this case, the stand is a member of two
\bgroupCode:groups\b, All and Timber.

\i20.\fb-\f0	Press the Close button at the bottom of the window.
The window will disappear.

\fb3.\f0	Change the length of the simulation from the default
to 150 years.

\i20.\fb-\f0	Press the "Set Time Scale" button on the selections
window.

\i20.\fb-\f0	Change the common ending year to year 2141 by editing
the value in the text edit box or by using the horizontal slidebar.  

\i20.\fb-\f0	Press Ok.

\fb4.\f0	Run the simulation.  Having selected stand data for
FVS, the model can be run without further input.  Default settings for
running the simulation are set by Suppose automatically.

\i20.\fb-\f0	Press the Run Simulation button on the main menu.  A
"Save As" window will appear, prompting you to specify a simulation
file name.

\i20.\fb-\f0	Without changing the directory, enter a name for the
simulation file.  For this example, use the name \fcTask1.key\f0.
Always use the file suffix \fc.key\f0 for simulation files (Unix
users, remember that file names are case sensitive).

\i20.\fb-\f0	Press Ok on the Save As window.  A Run window will appear.

At this point, in addition to the simulation file, a batch file (in
Windows) or a Korn Shell script (in Unix) is created.  This batch file
or Korn Shell script remains on the file system after the run is completed
and can be run independently from Suppose.

\i20.\fb-\f0	Press the Run button.  On Windows, all windows may
temporarily disappear as Suppose invokes FVS to complete the
simulation.  When the simulation is over, you will be in the system editor.

At this point, the simulation is complete and the output is written to
a file called \fcTask1.out\f0. In task 2 of the tutorial
you will learn how to view the output using a system editor.  In the
next step, you see how to use the \lGENERATEGraphs:Generate Graphs\l
tool to make a graph of the output. 

\fb5.\f0       Cause Suppose to scan the FVS output file (in this
case, the file is \fcTask1.out\f0) and to draw a graph of stand's 
top height and quadratic mean DBH over simulated time.

\i20.\fb-\f0	Press Gen. Graphs.  Two windows will open.  The first
is the \lGENERATEGraphs:Generate Graphs\l window and the second is the
\lREADFVSOutput:Read FVS Output\l window.  The second window will be
on top of the window stack.  Note that the File box contains the name
\fcTask1.out\f0.

\i20.\fb-\f0	Press Read File to cause Suppose to scan this output
file and store some of the results in memory.  Note that the list box
in the center of this window now contains one \bcasE:case\b.  Now
press Close.  The Generate Graphs window should now be on top of the
window stack.

\i20.\fb-\f0	Press Pick Variable in the upper right-hand side of
this window.  A \lVARIABLEPicker:Pick Variable\l window will open.  
Pick top height by selecting \fcTopHt\f0 from the variables list.
This is the top height variable from the FVS Summary Statistics table
corresponding to the simulation you make for this task.  Press Ok to
accept this selection and close the Pick Variable window.

The trend of top height over time is now displayed in the Generate
Graph window.  

\i20.\fb-\f0	Press Next Variable to add quadratic mean DBH to the
graph.  The variable name is QMD.  Since this variable is the one
following TopHt in the list of variables, Suppose automatically
selects it for the current \bcasE:case\b and the selected report. 

Note that both lines are drawn as a proportion of their respective
maximum values.  The purpose of the Suppose graphing tool is to
provide quick graphs that illustrate trends in the data.  See 
\lgraphScaling:How Scaling is Done\l for an explanation of the scaling
logic.

\fb6.\f0       If you wish to end this tutorial session and exit
Suppose now, press the Exit button at the bottom of the Selections
window.  To return to the tutorial at a later time, simply restart the
tutorial using the Help menu item and selecting Tutorial.  

To proceed with task two, press here:  
\lTutorialTask2:Task 2. Alter simulation file created in Task 1\l

HTOPIC TutorialTask2 "Task 2. Alter simulation file created in Task 1"Tutorial
\fbTask 2. Alter simulation file created in Task 1\f0

This task assumes that you have completed task 1 and that you have
stored the simulation file for task 1 as file \fcTask1.key\f0.  

The task includes making 2 simulations.  In the first simulation,  
seedtree regeneration harvest is added to the simulation created in
task 1.  The harvest is scheduled to occur when FVS detects
culmination of mean annual increment.  In addition, a "Post
Processor" that displays the output file in a system editor is added
to the run.

To facilitate the second simulation, a tool used to change the
original settings for the harvest is introduced.  Some of the seedtree
parameters are changed and the simulation is rerun.

Finally, a graph of stand top height for Task1 and Task2 is drawn
showing how this variable can be compared among simulations.

\fb1.\f0	Open the simulation file.

\i20.\fb-\f0	Use the File menu, and the Open item.  Use the file
selection dialog to pick file \fcTask1.key\f0.  Press Ok.  

Note that the Selections window displays the name of the simulation
file and that the contents include 1 stand and 2 groups.

\fb2.\f0	Add a Seedtree regeneration harvest to the simulation.

\i20.\fb-\f0	Press the Management Actions button on the selections
window.

\i20.\fb-\f0	Select Even-aged: Regeneration Harvesting from the list of
potential management actions in the left-hand column.  A list of
options under this category of actions will appear in the right-hand column.

\i20.\fb-\f0	Select Seedtree from the list of options in the 
right-hand column.  The Seedtree window will appear with possible 
settings for this management action.

\i20.\fb-\f0	Select the Schedule by Condition radio button at the
top of the window.

\f1The Schedule by Condition radio button and the Condition button are
found at the top right of the window and look like this:\f0

\pFigures/sched2.bmp\p

\i20.\fb-\f0	Press the Condition button to view the condition
definition and tools used to calibrate the condition.

\i20.\fb-\f0	Since the Culmination of Mean Annual Increment is
already selected, press the OK button at the bottom of the condition
window.  The Seedtree window will reappear.

\i20.\fb-\f0	Examine all other settings in this window, scrolling
down as necessary.

\i20.\fb-\f0	Press the OK button at the bottom of the window.
The Management Actions window will reappear.

\i20.\fb-\f0	Press the Close button at the bottom of the 
Management Actions window. The Selections window will reappear.

These steps can be repeated as many times as necessary to select a
series of management actions or to add other FVS keywords affecting
the simulation.

\fb3.\f0	Add a post processor to view the output.

\i20.\fb-\f0	Press the "Select Post Processor" on the selections
window.  

\i20.\fb-\f0	Scroll down and click on the item "View the Main Output
file using system editor."  If you single click, press the Include button
at the bottom of the screen.  If you double click, the item will
automatically be included.  Insure that the select post processor is
listed in the list box labeled "Included post processors," then press the
Close button.

\fb4.\f0	Run the simulation.  

\i20.\fb-\f0	Press "Run Simulation" on the main window, select Save
As, and specify that the name is \fcTask2.key\f0.   Then press Run on
the run dialog.

Note that the simulation will run and that the output file will
automatically be loaded into the system editor.  After viewing the
output, close the editor and return to Suppose.

\fb5.\f0	Change the settings for the condition for the seedtree.

\i20.\fb-\f0	Press the Edit Simulation File button on the
selections window. The Edit Simulation window will appear.  

This window provides access to \bcomponenT:components\b of the
simulation file.  You can select a component, and then change it using
the same tool used to create it originally.  For an in-depth explanation
of this window see: \lEDITSimulationFile:Edit Simulation File\l

Use Edit Simulation window to modify an existing component.  If you
use "Use FVS Keywords" or "Management Actions" instead, you will be
creating new components rather than editing those that already exist.

\i20.\fb-\f0	Select the "Condition - Seedtree" component in the
left-hand list box. 

\i20.\fb-\f0	Press the "Edit Selection" button at the bottom of the
screen or double-click on "Condition - Seedtree" to bring up the
appropriate screen for editing the settings.

\i20.\fb-\f0	At the bottom of the condition window, you will find a
text edit box corresponding to "Years before condition can be tested
after being found true"  Change the number from 50 to 999 to specify
that only one harvest will be simulated regardless of the length of
the simulation.

\i20.\fb-\f0	Press "Ok" to save the changes.

\i20.\fb-\f0 	Once all actions or keywords of interest have been
changed, press the Close button at the bottom-right corner of the
"Edit Simulation" window.

If you wish to add management actions or keywords
(\bcomponenT:components\b) to the simulation, you may do so at any
time.  Additions to the simulation will be reflected in the Edit
Simulation File window once they are made.  In this way, you may add
new components and edit existing ones in the same session.

\fb6.\f0	Press "Run Simulation" to rerun the simulation. 

The last step of the Task 2 is to draw a graph of stand top height for
Task1 and Task2.  First, close the editor used to view the outputs.

\fb7.\f0 	The last step of the Task 2 is to draw a graph of 
stand top height for Task1 and Task2.  

\i20.\fb-\f0	Close the editor used to view the outputs.

\i20.\fb-\f0	Press "Gen. Graphs" on the Selections window.  

Do \fbA\f0 or \fbB\f0:

\i30.\fbA-\f0	If you exited Suppose between accomplishing Task 1 and
Task 2, the Read FVS Output window will now be opened on top of the
Generate Graphs window and the list of \bcasE:cases\b will be empty.
In this situation, you need Suppose to read two files.  First, type
the name \fcTask1.out\f0 in the file box and then press Read File.
Second, change the name in the file box to \fcTask2.out\f0 and then
press Read File.

\i30.\fbB-\f0	If you did not exit from Suppose between accomplishing
Task 1 and Task 2, the Read FVS Output window will \f1not\f0 open on top of
the Generate Graphs window.  Press Read FVS Output button found on the
bottom of the Generate Graphs window to cause the window to open.
After it does, the file box will already contain \fcTask2.out\f0 and
the first \bcasE:case\b will correspond to Task 1.  Press "Read File"
to cause Suppose to read the output file for Task 2.

At this point, you will have two cases listed, the first corresponds
to the output from Task 1 and the second to Task 2.

\i20.\fb-\f0	Press "Close" on the Read FVS Output window.  The
Generate Graphs window will be on top of the window stack.

\i20.\fb-\f0	Press "Pick Variable" and select TopHt for the first
\bcasE:case\b and then press "Ok".  The TopHt from Task 1 example will
be plotted.

\i20.\fb-\f0	Press "Next Case" to cause TopHt to be plotted for the
output from Task 2.  Can you explain why TopHt increases then falls?

At this point you have completed Task 2.  

For additional experience, add the FVS ResetAge keyword to the
simulation.  Schedule the ResetAge to occur under the same condition
used to schedule the seedtree harvest.  This is done with the "Attach
to..." button found on the condition window and then highlighting the
condition you are using to schedule the seedtree harvest.  Using this
approach, the ResetAge keyword is triggered at the same time that the
seed tree cut is triggered.  Does adding this keyword change the
results of the simulation?  Use the Generate Graphs window to plot
variables that are important to you.

To proceed with task three, press here:  
\lTutorialTask3:Task 3. Set up a 6 stand run\l

HTOPIC TutorialTask3 "Task 3. Set up a 6 stand run" Tutorial
\fbTask 3.  Set up a 6 stand run\f0

Setting up a 6 stand run will illustrate features of Suppose designed
to handle multiple stand projections.  It will demonstrate the
importance of \bgroupCode:group codes\b and how to use them.  It will
reinforce the techniques presented in tasks 1 and 2.

The general steps followed by this task are to first enter the 6
stands into the simulation, then set up some silviculture treatments
for the stands.  Setting up the treatments will be done for each of
two groups rather than once for each stand.  However, since one of the
stands is bare ground, we will also set up a planting specifically for
the stand rather than for groups.

The techniques used in this exercise can be scaled up to making
projections for several hundred stands, that is, for a landscape.

There are 5 major steps to this task, ending in running the
simulation.  Following step 5, additional steps are included that
demonstrate ways to use the Edit Simulation tool and introduce the
tool used to change the group membership in a run.

\fb1.\f0	The first step in this task is to insure that the tutorial
data are installed and active.  Doing so will cause the tutorial
screen to reload.  Press the "Help" menu on the Suppose menu bar (not
the menu bar on this help window) and select item "Tutorial".
Allow suppose to reload the tutorial data and then scroll back to this
location.

\fb2.\f0	Add the 6 stands of the tutorial into the simulation.

\i20.\fb-\f0	Press "Select Simulation Stands".

\i20.\fb-\f0 	Press the "All Stands" button first, prior to
selecting any locations or any groups.  This button actually has two
meanings.  If pressed when there are no stands in the Available Stands
list, Suppose automatically insures that all the stands referenced
through the \llocationsFile:locations file\l are loaded into the
available stands list.  Press the "All Stands" button a second time to
cause Suppose to automatically load all the stands.  

\i20.\fb-\f0 	Finally, press "Add 6 Stands" and then "Close".  

Help topics regarding the
\lSELECTSIWinStandListBox:Available Stands List\l and controling the
logic used by Suppose in loading 
\lSELECTSIWinStandSelectionButtons:stands from any or every group\l
further explain the tools you just used to load the 6 stands. 

Note that the contents of the simulation are 6 stands and 3 groups.
Furthermore, the "Current Group" radio button is selected and the
group "All" is listed in the "Current..." list button.

\f1The "Current Group" or "Current Stand" list button is found in the 
lower right part of the Selections window above the Change Group
Membership button.\f0

\pFigures/listbutt.bmp\p

\fb3.\f0	Set up management actions customized for each group of
stands.  There are two groups, Timber and Riparian.  For the Timber
stands we will specify clear cutting at culmination of m.a.i.  For the
Riparian stands we will specify a one entry shelterwood, without a
shelterwood removal cut.

\i20.\fb-\f0	Open the "Current Group" or "Current Stand" list 
button on the Selections window.  You should see 3 groups listed: All,
Timber, and Riparian.  Select the Timber group using your mouse.

\i20.\fb-\f0 	Press "Management Actions", select Regeneration Harvesting,
select clearcut, specify the condition of the clearcut and so on using
skills developed in Task 1.  Press "Ok" on the condition and clearcut
windows to accept the condition and action \bcomponenT:components\b.
Return to the selections window either by closing the management
actions window or by using your mouse bring the selections window to
the top.

\i20.\fb-\f0 	Reopen the list button on the Selections window
and select the Riparian group.

\i20.\fb-\f0 	Press "Management Actions", select Regeneration
Harvesting, select one entry shelterwood, schedule by condition,
press the Condition button, take the default condition, and press OK to
both the condition and shelterwood windows.  This will schedule shelterwood
for the Riparian group.  

\fb4.\f0 	For the BareGrnd stand, plant 300 trees per
acre of Douglas-fir if you are in the west and 300 trees per acre of
natural red pine if you are in the east in the first year of the projection.

\i20.\fb-\f0 	On the Selections window, find and select the radio button
"Current Stand".  Then open the list button to the right.  It now
lists stands rather than groups.  Pick the BareGrnd stand as the
current stand.

\i20.\fb-\f0 	Press the "Use FVS Keywords" button, select the
extension "Full Establishment Model", pick the Plant keyword and click the
accept button.  Leave the scheduling options set at the defaults.  Set the
species to plant to Douglas fir (west) or natural red pine (east) and the
number of trees to 300.  Press "Ok".  Close the Use FVS Keywords window.

\fb5.\f0	Run the simulation.  Name the simulation file 
\fcTask3.key\f0.  If you like, prior to running the simulation, you
may select a post processor that will view the output file.

\fb6.\f0	Use the Edit Simulation tool to better understand 
the run's contents.

\i20.\fb-\f0 	Press "Edit Simulation."

Notice that the window opens with a list of components for the
"Selected Stand" and that stand BareGrnd is selected.  This is due to
the "Current Stand" radio button being set and BareGrnd being the
current stand.

The component list includes, in the order they will be in the
simulation file, the components that are part of stand BareGrnd.
Note, however, that not all components are unique to BareGrnd.  In
fact, only the Plant keyword is in BareGrnd and not in the other
stands.  But, since BareGrnd is part of groups All and Timber, the
components associated with those groups are also part of stand
BareGrnd.  

\i20.\fb-\f0 	On the "Edit Simulation" window, select the component
"Clearcut."  

Notice that the list of stands changed to include only those that
contain the clearcut and that the "Affected Groups" list now lists
"Timber".

Read the \lEDITSimulationFile:Edit Simulation File\l help topic for a
full explanation of how this tool works and then return to the
tutorial.

\fb7.\f0	Close the "Edit Simulation" window.

\fb8.\f0	Press "Change Group Membership" on the selections
window.

Notice that the groups are listed as column headings and the rows are
stands.  Check boxes indicate which stands are members of which
groups.  

\fb9.\f0	Take BareGrnd out of the Timber group and place it in
the Riparian group.

\i20.\fb-\f0 	Click in the check box below Timber for the BareGrnd
stand.  The check box will change to show that BareGrnd has been
removed from the Timber group.

\i20.\fb-\f0 	Click in the check box below Riparian for the BareGrnd
stand.  The check box will change to show that BareGrnd has been
added to the Riparian group.

\i20.\fb-\f0 	Close the window and reopen the "Edit Simulation" file
window.  Notice that a shelterwood is scheduled for the stand rather than
a clearcut.

At this point, you can rerun the simulation, if you wish.  Otherwise,
consider this task complete.

To proceed with task four, press here: 
\lTutorialTask4:Task 4. Explore advanced features of Suppose\l

HTOPIC TutorialTask4 "Task 4. Explore advanced features of Suppose" Tutorial
\fbTask 4.  Explore advanced features of Suppose\f0

In this task we will explore some advanced features of Suppose.  
The first goal is to demonstrate how to use the free-form editor to
modify logical expressions and to use the \bparmS:parms\b feature
of FVS.  The second goal is to demonstrate how to save and retrieve
sets of keywords to and from files.  A set of keywords will be created
in one simulation and then added to another.

\fb1.\f0	Restart the tutorial to insure that the tutorial data
are loaded and being accessed by Suppose and that a new simulation
file is being created.  When you are not using the tutorial data, you
would start a new simulation by using the "File menu" and the "New" option.  

\fb2.\f0	Press "Use FVS Keywords" to create a
\bcomponenT:component\b that can be scheduled.  Pick the keyword
ThinABA to schedule a thinning from above to a basal area target.

\fb3.\f0	Select "Schedule by Condition", and press the
"Condition" button.  Open the "Condition library" and select the
condition titled "Stocking above percentage of normal".  Set the
percentage with the slidebar to 70 percent and press "Ok".

\fb4.\f0	Set the residual stand basal area for the thinning to
99 (it will be an easy number to spot in the next step).

\fb5.\f0	Press the "Use Parms" button.  At this point you will
be warned about using the \bparmS:parms\b feature.  Press Yes to the
warning.

A window opens that displays the keyword in a form that uses the parms
feature and the original keyword window closes.  You are now in
a window used to edit expressions and make other "free form" changes
to components of a simulation.  This window does no error checking.
For more information on the window see the topic: 
\lEXPRESSWindow:Edit Expressions\l.

\fb6.\f0	Change the target residual basal area from 99 to an
expression signifying that the residual is 50 percent of the current
basal area (not a very well thought out silvicultural option, but it
illustrates how to edit expressions!).

\i20.\fb-\f0 	Use the list of Variables to find the one that
tracks "Before thin basal area," or BBA.  

\i20.\fb-\f0 	Click the mouse between "Parms(" and "99" thereby
setting an insertion point. 

\i20.\fb-\f0 	Press the "Insert" button at the bottom of the window.

\i20.\fb-\f0 	Use the mouse and keyboard to change the first
argument of the Parms function to BBA*.5, make sure to delete the 99.0.  

\i20.\fb-\f0 	Press the "Ok" button and close the "Use FVS Keywords"
window.

You now have created 2 components.  The first is the condition, and
the second is the thinning keyword.  

\fb8.\f0	Edit the condition component using the "Expression Editor". 

\i20.\fb-\f0 	Press "Edit Simulation File" on the selections
window.  The condition and the thinning keyword are both listed as
separate components.

\i20.\fb-\f0 	Select the condition and press "Edit Selection".  

\i20.\fb-\f0 	Use the "Extras" menu item found on the menu bar 
and select "Edit Logical Expression" (on Windows there is one menu
bar on the Suppose Task window on Unix there is a menu bar for each
window; use the one on the Condition window).  You will get a similar 
warning to the one issued for using the parms feature.  Press "Yes".

Now you are in the expression editor and you are editing a condition.
Change the expression so that the Event Monitor uses the average DBH
of trees over 5 inches rather than all trees.  To do so requires
changing the string "BADBH" to "SpMcDBH(5,All,0,5,200,0,500,0)"

\fb9.\f0	There are two ways to change this string.  The first
involves simply using the mouse to replace the unwanted string with
the desired string.  Alternatively, you can use the tools built into
the expression editor to aid you in creating the SpMcDBH string and
insert it into the expression.  This alternative approach will
demonstrate more of the capabilities of the expression editor that may
be useful in the future.

\i20.\fb-\f0 	Find the SpMcDBH function under FVS Function.

\f1There are two list buttons, one on top of the other.  The top list
 controls the content of the one below it.  This figure illustrates
the contents when the first is set to FVS Functions and the second is
set to SpMcDBH()\f0.

\i20.\fb-\f0 	Press "Set Function Arguments".  The contents of the
Expression Editor window will change.  Use the elements of this window
to set the arguments of the function.  Set the attribute to be
returned to Quadratic mean DBH, the species to All species, the tree
value class to All, and the lower DBH limit to 5.  Leave the other
settings at their defaults.

\i20.\fb-\f0 	Press "Finished Setting Function".

\i20.\fb-\f0 	Place the insert point in the expression using the
mouse.  Then press the "Insert" button.  

\i20.\fb-\f0 	Finish the editing by removing the unwanted BADBH.

\i20.\fb-\f0	Close the expression editor.  The "Edit Simulation File"
window should now be opened and exposed.  If it is not, press the
"Edit Simulation File" button on the selections window.

\fb10.\f0	Instruct Suppose to write both of these components
to an output file called \fcTask4.kcp\f0.

\i20.\fb-\f0 	Use the mouse to select the condition component.

\i20.\fb-\f0 	Press the "Append" button.  A file
selection dialog will appear.  Set the file name to \fcTask4.kcp\f0
and press "Ok" to save the keyword to the file.

\i20.\fb-\f0 	Repeat this process for the ThinABA keyword component.

\fb11.\f0	Start a new simulation file by using the Help menu
and Tutorial item.  This approach will insure that the tutorial data
are accessed by Suppose.  Usually you can start a new simulation file
by using the "New" item of the "File" menu.  A dialog asking if you
wish to discard the current simulation file will appear.  Press
"Discard".

\fb12.\f0	Select a simulation stand using the methods described
in Task 1 of the tutorial.  

\fb13.\f0	Add the components in \fcTask4.kcp\f0 using the 
"Edit Simulation File" window.  

\i20.\fb-\f0	On the "Edit Simulation File" window, press the "Insert
from file" button.  A file selection dialog will open.  Select the
\fcTask4.kcp\f0 and press "Ok".

You can verify that the components are inserted in the simulation by
running it.

A final note concerning components that are inserted into the
simulation file.  Suppose has the capability to automate the process
of adding components to the simulation.  Components can be
automatically added through group membership or they can be
added using special records in the stand list file.  See
help topics describing the \llocationsFile:locations\l and 
\lstandlistFile:stand list\l files for more information.  If you
notice some components in your simulation file that you did not add,
they were likely automatically added using one of these techniques.
Regardless of their origin, you can edit or delete them from your
simulation file.  Doing so does not change the content of the original
files.

\fbThis ends Task 4.\f0

\fbNow that you've come this far...\f0

Now that you've come this far, please explore Suppose features not
used during the course of the tutorial.  By creating, manipulating,
saving, and retrieving simulations, you will gradually build up a
familiarity with Suppose that will encourage you to more extensive use
of all available FVS capabilities.
