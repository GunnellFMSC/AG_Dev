HTOPIC GRPMEMBWindow "Change Group Membership" names stand group management-identification membership 
\fbChange Group Membership\f0

The Change Group Membership window is used to change the membership of
stands to groups, add new groups, change the names of
\bgroupCode:groups\b or \bstanD:stands\b, and set the
\bmgmtiD:management identification codes\b for stands.  Changes you make
in this window take place as you make them.  There is NO cancel
button!

However, changes made using this window only affect the 
\bsimfilE:simulation file\b you are working on.  They are not
reflected in the \bSLf:stand list files\b nor any other data source.

Group membership is shown by check boxes.  Add a stand to a group by
checking the box in the group's column corresponding to the stand.
Remove a stand from a group by "unchecking" its membership.

Change the name of a group by editing the name shown (note that
blanks are not allowed in group names).  Add a group by typing a name
in the first empty group column.

Change the name of a stand by editing the name shown.

Change, or establish, a stand management identification by entering
or editing the management identification fields.

Use the \f1vertical scrollbar\f0 to scroll to stands that are not
shown (you can also resize this window to get additional or fewer rows
and columns).

Use the \f1horizontal scrollbar\f0 to scroll to groups that are not
shown. 

\f1Set Membership\f0 opens a dialog that allows you to set the
membership of any group as a function of membership in one or two
other groups.  For example, you could define a group, and then set its
membership to be all the stands that are not in another group, or all
the stands that are in one group and another.  Inside the dialog
window there are two buttons, one is used to \f1Apply\f0 the group
membership operation you defined, and the other is used to \f1Close\f0
the dialog window.

\f1Set Mgmtids\f0 (set management identifications), allows you to set
the management identification for all stands in any selected group.
This dialog window also has two buttons, one to \f1Apply\f0 the
settings you made, and the other to \f1Close\f0 the dialog window.

Use \f1Close\f0 to close the window.  Remember, there are no "Cancel"
nor "Undo" buttons in this window.  Your settings take effect as you
make them.
