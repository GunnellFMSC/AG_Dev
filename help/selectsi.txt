HTOPIC SELECTSIWindow "Select Simulation Stands" stand group space
\fbSelect Simulation Stands\f0

The Select Simulation Stands window supports the process of picking 
\bstanD:stand(s)\b that will be included in the simulation.  This
window is accessed using the Select Simulation Stands button on the
Selections window, or by using the menu item of the same name under
the Basics menu.  
\a

Stands are picked from a list of 
\lSELECTSIWinStandListBox:available stands\l and are added to the 
simulation using the
\lSELECTSIWinAddStandsButton:Add Stand(s)\l button.

Prior to using this window, it is good to gain a basic understanding
of the \lvegdatA:vegetation data used by Suppose\l.  However, you may
wish to experiment with the tools in this window first and then learn
about the source of the data!

The following topics provide detailed information on the window's
elements:

\lSELECTSIWinByLocOrGroupButtons:Pick Locations First or Pick Groups First\l
\lSELECTSIWinLocListBox:Locations List\l
\lSELECTSIWinGroupListBox:Groups List\l
\lSELECTSIWinStandListBox:Available Stands List\l
\lSELECTSIWinStandIDText:Desired Stand\l
\lSELECTSIWinAddFileYesOrNoButtons:Include or Do Not Include Add Files\l
\lSELECTSIWinStandSelectionButtons:Stands Listed From Any or Every Group\l

Note that you may use this window repeatedly and you may add stands to
a simulation at any time.

HTOPIC SELECTSIWinByLocOrGroupButtons "Pick Locations First or Pick Groups First"
\fbPick Locations or Pick Groups First\f0

Two radio buttons \lSELECTSIWindow:Select Simulation Stands\l window
allow you to narrow the possible list of available
stands using one of two strategies.  The first strategy, Pick Locations First,
is to first pick one or more locations from the locations list.  A
location will appear in the list for each one listed in the
\llocationsFile:locations file\l.  Picking one or more locations will
cause \bgroupCode:Groups\b that are represented at the selected locations
to be listed in the group list.  Selecting one or more groups will cause
the stands to be listed in the list of available stands if they are in 
\lSELECTSIWinStandSelectionButtons:any or every selected group\l and 
are located at any of the selected locations, to be listed in the 
available stand list.

The second strategy, Pick Groups First, is to first pick one or more groups.
The locations where the groups are represented are then listed in the
locations list box.  Selecting one or more locations will cause stands
that are found at the selected locations, and members of 
\lSELECTSIWinStandSelectionButtons:any or every selected groups,\l
to be listed in the available stand list.

Use Pick Locations First, the default, unless you see a clear benefit
to the Pick Groups First strategy.

HTOPIC SELECTSIWinLocListBox "Locations List"
\fbLocations List\f0

The locations list contains a list of locations referenced in the
\llocationsFile:locations file\l.  You can pick one or more
locations.  See the 
\lSELECTSIWinByLocOrGroupButtons:Pick Locations First or Pick Groups First\l
topic for information on how this list is loaded.

To select one location, simply click on the desired location.  To
select all the locations, point the mouse at the first location and
press down on the left mouse button.  While holding the left mouse
button down, drag the mouse to the bottom of the list.  Hold the mouse
down until all items are selected and then release it.

To select two different locations, first select the first and then
select the second while holding down the shift key.

To deselect one location, hold the control key down and click the left
mouse button.

To reload the list, press the Pick Locations First or the Pick Groups
First radio buttons.

HTOPIC SELECTSIWinGroupListBox "Groups List"
\fbGroups List\f0

The groups list contains a list of \bgroupCode:group codes\b.  The
group codes are those specified in the \bSLf:stand list files\b.  See
the \lSELECTSIWinByLocOrGroupButtons:Pick Locations First or Pick Groups First\l
topic for information on how this list is loaded.

You can pick any combination of groups.  See
\lSELECTSIWinLocListBox:Locations List\l to see how to make
multiple selections and deselections in list boxes.

To reload the list, press the Pick Locations First or the Pick Groups
First radio buttons.

HTOPIC SELECTSIWinStandListBox "Available Stands List"
\fbAvailable Stands List\f0

Stands picked from this list will be added to the simulation when
you press the \lSELECTSIWinAddStandsButton:Add Stand(s)\l button.  

Stands in this list are those that are in a selected location and in
\lSELECTSIWinStandSelectionButtons:any or every selected group\l,
depending on the logic used to add stands to the list. 

You can pick more than one stand prior to adding stands.  Hold the
shift key down and click the left mouse button to select additional
stands.  Hold the control key down and click the left mouse button to
deselect a group.  

To pick all stands, press the All Stands button or point the mouse at
the first stand, press down on the left mouse button, while holding the
left mouse button down, drag the mouse to the bottom of the list.

Note that the All Stands button has a special meaning in the case
where no stands are listed in the available stands list.  In that
special case, pressing this button will cause all stands, at all
locations, to be loaded into the available stands list.  Pressing it a
second time selects all the stands.  See topic
\lSELECTSIWinStandSelectionButtons:Stands Listed From Any or Every Group\l 
for more information.

You can use the \lSELECTSIWinStandIDText:Desired Stand\l text entry to
type a stand identification of a stand you desire.  Press the CR key
to cause Suppose to search for the desired stand and mark for possible
addition.

The number of stands in the available stand list is displayed at the
top of the list when the list contains some entries.

The number of picked stands is shown on the
\lSELECTSIWinAddStandsButton:Add Stand(s)\l button.

To reload the list, reselect a group or location.

HTOPIC SELECTSIWinStandIDText "Desired Stand"
\fbDesired Stand\f0

You can cause a stand to be picked from the 
\lSELECTSIWinStandListBox:Available Stands List\l by entering the
stand identification into the desired stand text box and pressing the
CR key.  Suppose will search the available stands list for the stand
and mark it picked if it is found.  You must still press the 
\lSELECTSIWinAddStandsButton:Add Stand(s)\l button to cause the stand(s)
to be added to the simulation.

All of the stands that match the search string (which can be a \f1regular
expression\f0, see instructions below) are marked selected.

If you use this text box when the
\lSELECTSIWinStandListBox:Available Stands List\l is empty,
Suppose will automatically load all stands referenced through the 
\blocatioN:locations file\b into the available stand list.  The 
resulting list is then searched for the desired stand.  To load all
stands into the list, Suppose sets the stand selection criteria so
that stands are listed as available if they are in 
\lSELECTSIWinStandSelectionButtons:any selected group\l.  Suppose then
automatically selects all locations and all groups.

When the Select Simulation Stands window opens, Suppose checks to see
if there are stands in the simulation.  If there are already stands in
the simulation, the identification code of the last stand is entered
into the desired stand text edit box as a default.  If you wish to add
that stand again, simply click inside the box, and press the CR key.
Suppose will search for the stand and mark it picked if it is found.
You can also edit this box.

\fbUsing Regular Expressions to Find Desired Stands\f0

As stated above, you can enter a \f1regular expression\f0 as a search
string when looking for desired stands.  Regular expressions are
search strings that allow you to search for a string without knowing
its exact match or in the case where you want to find all the strings
that match the search criteria.  For example, if you are looking for
all stands that contain the numbers 123 as the first 3 characters you
can use a regular expression to find the stands with those characters.

If you want the search string to be a regular expression, code an
equal sign (\fb=\f0) as the first character (this character is not
used in the regular expression).  Otherwise, the string is
taken as a simple string and the match must be exact.  In either case,
Suppose marks all stands that match search criteria as selected.

When a regular expression is coded, special characters are used in the
search.  These rules are long standing in the computer industry are
are used in Suppose without modification.  Be very aware that these
search rules are different than those used in finding files, say with
a dir command in DOS.

1.  The following determine one-character regular expressions:

1.1  Any character that is not a special character (listed below)
matches itself.

1.2  A backslash (\\) followed by a special character matches the
special character.  That is, the backslash \f1escapes\f0 the special
character.  For example, you want the special character \f1$\f0 to match
itself, then code \f1\\$\f0.

1.3  The special characters are: + * ? . [ ] ^ $

1.4  The period (.) matches any character except the end-of-line
character.

1.5  A set of characters enclosed in brackets is a one-character
regular expression that matches any character in the set.  For
example, \f1[123]\f0 matches either 1 or 2 or 3.  A range can be
indicated with a dash.  For example, \f1[0-9]\f0 matches any number.
However, if the first character inside the brackets is a caret (^),
then the match is any character that is not in the set.  So,
\f1[^0-9]\f0 matches any character that is not a number.

2.  The following can be used to build multicharacter regular expressions:

2.1  One or more one-character regular expressions can be put together
to form a multicharacter expression.  For example, the string \f1ab\f0
is two regular expressions that follow rule 1.1 (that is, the 2
letters only match themselves).

2.2  A one-character regular expression followed by an asterisk (*)
matches zero or more occurrences of the expression.  So, \f1[0-9]*\f0
matches zero or more numbers.

2.3  A one-character regular expression followed by a plus sign (+)
matches one or more occurrences of the expression.  So, \f1[0-9]+\f0
matches one or more numbers.

2.3  If a question mark (?) is include, then the regular expression
that preceeds it can occur zero or once, but no more.  So,
\f1a[0-9]?\f0, matches the letter a, followed by zero or one number,
but not more than one number.

3. A multicharacter regular expression can be anchored to match only
the beginning or end of a line.

3.1 If a caret (^) is at the beginning of the regular expression, then
the matched string must be at the beginning of the line.  In Suppose,
when searching for a list of stands, use the caret (^) to insure that
the string starts in the first character of the stand identification.
For example, the regular expression \f13\f0 matches any stand that has
a 3 in the identification.  But, the expression \f1^3\f0 matches
only stands that have a 3 as the first character.

3.2 If a dollar sign ($) is at the end of the regular expression, then
the matched string must be at the end of the line.  When searching for
a list of stands, use the dollar sign ($) to insure that the string is
at the end of the stand identification.  For example, the regular
expression \f13\f0 matches any stand that has a 3 in the the
identification.  But, the expression \f13$\f0 matches only stands that
have a 3 as the last character.

Other rules governing regular expressions do not apply to searching a
list as is the case in Suppose.

HTOPIC SELECTSIWinAddFileYesOrNoButtons "Include or Do Not Include AddFiles"
\fbInclude or Do Not Include AddFiles\f0

\baddfilE:Addfiles\b that are explicitly related to \bstanD:stands\b
or \bgroupCode:groups\b are added to the simulation when picked stands
are added.  The contents of the addfiles become \bcomponenT:components\b.

Use the Include or Do Not Include AddFiles radio buttons to control
the automatic addition of these files.

Read help topics that describe the \lvegdatA:vegetation data\l for
more general background and information regarding the 
\llocationsFile:Locations\l and \lstandlistFile:Stand List\l files for
detailed information on how addfiles are related to groups and stands.

HTOPIC SELECTSIWinStandSelectionButtons "Stands Listed From Any or Every Group"
\fbStands Listed From Any or Every Group\f0

You can control how \bgroupCode:group\b membership is used to load the
list of \lSELECTSIWinStandListBox:available stands\l.  

In the first case, a stand is added to the list of available stands if
it is in any selected group.

In the second case, a stand is added to the list only if it is in
every selected group.  This is the default.

Note that the All Stands button, located below the 
\lSELECTSIWinStandListBox:Available Stands List\l 
has a special meaning in the case where no stands are listed in the 
available stands list.  In that special case, pressing this button
will cause all stands, at all locations, to be loaded into the
available stands list.  This is accomplished by Suppose automatically
changing the way stands are listed to the method whereby stands are
listed if they are in any selected group.  Then Suppose selects all
locations and all groups.  This results in the available stands list
being loaded with all stands referenced through the 
\llocationsFile:locations file\l.  Pressing this button a second time 
selects all the stands.  

HTOPIC SELECTSIWinCloseButton "Close"
\fbClose\f0

Close the Select Simulation Stands window.  You may reopen it at any
time.  

HTOPIC SELECTSIWinDelSButton "Delete Stand"
\fbDelete Stand\f0

Opens the \lDELETEStandWindow:Delete Stand\l window with the last
added stand preselected.

HTOPIC SELECTSIWinBareGroundButton "Bare Ground"
\fbBare Ground\f0

Push this button to add a bare ground stand to the vegetation data.
The stand is automatically added to a
\lstandlistFile:Stand List File\l called \f1baregrnd.slf\f0 which is
created if necessary.  And, the stand list file is automatically added
to the active  \llocationsFile:Locations file\l if it is not already
present. 

HTOPIC SELECTSIWinAddStandsButton "Add Stand(s) Button"
\fbAdd Stand(s)\f0

Press this button to add stands that are marked picked in the 
\lSELECTSIWinStandListBox:Available Stands List\l to the simulation.
Picked stands are not added until this button is pushed.
