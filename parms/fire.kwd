{Modify the FFE calculation of the probability that a tree will die due to fire.
The multipliers coded using this keyword are only in effect for the cycle or
year in which they are scheduled. Several FMORTMLT keywords can be specified for
the same time period where each applies to a different species or portion of the
tree DBH distribution. The values apply to fire effects computed for potential
fires as well as simulated fires that are scheduled for the same year. A major
purpose for using this keyword is to represent the effects drought in years
prior to the fire have on tree mortality (van Mantgem and others 2013). The
keyword can also be used to represent the effect on mortality of wet years prior
to fire. Values greater than 1.0 increase mortality rates, values less than 1.0
decrease mortality rates. 

Van Mantgem and others (2013) reported models that predict the probability of
mortality given tree bark thickness, fire severity measures, and changes in
climatic water deficit relative to long-term averages prior to fire. Using
results from that work the following general guidelines can be used to choose
multipliers on the FMORTMLT keyword. For low moisture deficit, code 1.2, for
moderate, code 1.4, for high code 1.6, for very high code 1.8. Of course, any
values may be used and you can use this keyword to represent other effects
besides climatic water deficit.
