description:
{Specifies the Climate Scenario to be used and the climate and species-viability data
to be read in. Data can be read in from an external file specified in field 2.

CAUTION:
Climate and species viability values can be inserted directly into the keyword file
as supplemental records, rather than specifying an external file name. When 
inserting data directly, the supplemental record following the GCM/scenario needs to
be an "*", followed by the climate header record and the final supplemental record 
needs to be -999.}
