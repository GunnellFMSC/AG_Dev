{Change the merchantability specification for sawlog volume and pulpwood volume 

With the LS, NE, and CS variants, default minimum DBH for sawlog and pulpwood
volumes vary by Forest. See the FVS Keyword Guide for defaults. 
CAUTION:
Species specific defaults are not yet supported within Suppose.}

description{sn se}:
{Change the merchantability specification for sawlog volume and pulpwood volume 

With the SE and SN variants: The default sawlog minimum DBH is 10" for
softwoods and 12.0" for hardwoods. The default pulpwood minimum DBH is 4.0" for 
hardwoods and softwoods.

The default minimum top diameter for sawlogs is 7.0" for softwoods and 9.0" 
for hardwoods. These values are fixed. Changing them will cause an error.

CAUTION:
Species specific defaults are not yet supported within Suppose.}

description{ni ie kt em}:
{Change the merchantability limits for board-foot volume and cubic foot volume 

With the NI, IE, KT, and EM variants: Board-foot and cubic foot, minimum 
merchantable DBH is 7.0", except for lodgepole pine which is 6.0" DBH

CAUTION:
Species specific defaults are not yet supported within Suppose.}

description{ci tt ut}:
{Change the merchantability limits for board-foot volume and cubic foot volume

With the CI, UT, and UT variants: Board-foot and cubic foot, minimum 
merchantable DBH is 8.0", except for lodgepole pine which is 7.0" DBH

CAUTION:
Species specific defaults are not yet supported within Suppose.}

description{ak}:
{Change the merchantability limits for board-foot volume and cubic foot volume

Board-foot defaults:
Minimum merchantable DBH is 9.0", except for sitka spruce which is 8.0".
Cubic foot defaults:
Minimum merchantable DBH for hardwoods is 11.0".
Minimum top diameter for hardwoods is 9.0"

CAUTION:
Species specific defaults are not yet supported within Suppose.}

description{bm ec so wc pn oc op}:
{Change the merchantability limits for board-foot volume and cubic foot volume

For BM, EC, WC, and PN varaints, minimum merchantable board-foot and cubic foot 
DBH is 7.0", except for lodgepole pine which is 6.0".
