description:
{Simulates a mastication fuel treatment consisting of a thinning
where the cut trees are chopped up and left on the ground.

Input parameters for the mastication include species, diameter class interval
and proportion cut.  The after-treatment chip size of the masticated trees
can also be controlled.

NOTE: The proportion of surface fuel composed of masticated pieces should be 
estimated by the proportion of the after-treatment surface fuel that is from
masticated trees, as well as whether or not pre-existing surface fuel is being
chipped up in addition to the standing trees.  For example, if only standing
trees are being masticated, this should be set to 1.0 only if there is no 
surface fuel present before treatment.  If only standing trees are being 
masticated and you have 5 tons/acre of pre-existing surface fuel and 5 tons/acre
from the mastication of standing trees, this should be set to 0.50 (5 tons/acre
from the mastication divided by 10 tons/acre of total surface fuel after the
mastication has been completed).

If both standing trees and pre-existing surface fuel are being masticated, set
this to 1.0, which will simulate the mastication of both pre-existing surface
fuel and material from standing trees.

If you would like to set different proportions for different size classes, this
can be done using multiple FuelMove keywords instead of using this window, or
these proportions can be variably set in the editor window by clicking the
"Use Editor" button.}
